Researching the implementation and deployment of RLN 
for the Status L2 architecture, including RLN proof provider and membership topics
## Description
This commitment entails researching and implementing of deployment of RLN 
for the gasless feature of Status L2 architecture. 
Currently, we have only the RLN backend, but before proceeding, 
we need to explore how RLN can be deployed alongside auxiliary components 
to ensure integrity and scalability. 
This commitment will include considerations for integrating an RLN-proof provider, 
verifier, and membership topics while optimizing the overall architecture for efficiency and performance. 

### Background
Status L2 is a rollup with Linea and builds a platform with the capacity 
to support SocialFi and GameFi apps, governance experiments, the Status voting system, and more
 â€“ all while aiming to keep transaction costs low and throughput high. 
Status L2 will incorporate a gasless feature, necessitating an effective anti-spam mechanism. 
Rate-Limiting Nullifier (RLN) is a potential solution that could be deployed on Status L2 
to prevent spam and support the gasless functionality. 

In 2025q1, we explore the Status L2 infrastructure to 
identify the best approach for deploying the RLN. 

### Narratives
 By utilizing this commitment, we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Sharing the RLN knowledge with the Status L2 team.
* Delivering the modified RLN design to make Status L2 gasless. 

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:
* Offering a use-case to the ecosystem that can be used for other gasless roll-up projects.
