## Description

Test libp2p on each new version or requested feature
and look for regressions,
learn scaling properties and run scaling studies,
understand the limits of Waku and its behaviour.
Deliver reports and actionable insights.
Do this monthly, reliably, with documentation of findings.

The scope of this commitment depends on the P2P team
work and improvements, and it is subjected to change.
