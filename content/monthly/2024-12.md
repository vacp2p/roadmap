### RFC
#### highlights

### Nim
#### highlights

- Smarter Dependency Resolution The SAT solver now falls back to a previous package version if the latest one is unsatisfiable.
- Improved Nim Version Selection Favors the user’s system Nim version if it meets the package requirements.
- Caching & Misc Improvements Caches tagged packages for faster lookups.Includes various fixes and performance improvements.

- Nimble Task integration (run tasks from the Extension)
- Nim check is now the default linting backend (you can revert to nimsuggest chk by setting "nim.useNimCheck": false). This should help to reduce nimsuggest issues as nimsuggest chk is one of the most extensive commands.
