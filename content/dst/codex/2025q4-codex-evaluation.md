## Description
Test Codex on each new version or requested feature
and look for regressions if this is required.
Help Codex with testing and benchmarking new features.

### Background

We want to learn specific, actionable information
about Codex's behaviour
and how it is evolving over time
with each new release
and with each thing we are specifically asked to check and test.

We will use a combination of real world testing,
theoretical analysis and experiments.

### Narratives
We will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative directly
by analysing and evaluating new Codex releases and their features,
both with regards to features they have today
and with regards to how that compares to past behaviour.

We will:

* Enable improvements to Codex
  by allowing for repeatable, measureable
  and real world insights into Codex,
  all the way from theory to practice and back.
* Reduce the risk of a Codex regression
  making it into a new release of Codex.

Additionally, these efforts will contribute
to the Premier Research destination narrative by:

* Improving and strengthening our relationship with the Codex team
  and improving the quality and reputation of IFT's work, inside
  and outside of Codex.

  
### Background

### Narratives

We will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative directly
by providing valuable insights to Codex
that allow them to understand how Codex performs
in comparison to common and popular systems in the "altruistic" space.
