Publishing a reviewing document for the cryptography and ZK modules of IFT projects
## Description

This commitment entails developing and maintaining an up-to-date repository 
of cryptography and zero-knowledge (ZK) topics from all IFT teams such as 
Waku, Nomos, Codex and Status, serving as a knowledge base for teams 
requiring expertise in these areas while also minimizing overlapping.

### Background

Many IFT projects utilize the cryptography as one of the components their architecture. 
As ACZ team, we collect all the cryptographical and ZK primitives into single commitment, 
review and compare them to detect potential improvable and strong aspects.

### Narratives
By utilizing the think-tank commitment, 
we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Create a document describing the review and compare cryptographic modules for each of Waku, 
Status, Codex, and Nimbus.
* Maintain the ZK think tank document review and compare ZK modules for each of Waku, 
Status, Codex, and Nimbus.
* Share the common know-how with the relevant project if needed.

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by: 
* Present the significant cryptographic findings on the [VAC forum](https://forum.vac.dev/) 
to initiate discussions and contribute to the benefit of the ecosystem.

### Additional Info

This commitment has been rescheduled from 2024Q4 to 2025Q1
since we need higher quality of the cryptography think tank, 
also maintain the ZK think tank with the latest improvements. 

## Task List

### Crypto Think Tank 

* fully qualified name: `vac:acz:ift:2025q1-think-tank:crypto-think-tank`
* owner: Ugur
* status: not started
* start-date: 2025/03/03
* end-date: 2025/03/17

#### Description 

Provide comprehensive documentation of cryptographic techniques used, developed and researched by IFT teams 
that is accessible and user-friendly to all IFT teams and the broader community. 
This task is important to diffuse the cryptographic components' how-know across the IFT. 
 
#### Deliverables 

* A notions page to maintain current (and accurate) information on each of IFT's usage of cryptographical components
such as creating randomness, signature, commitment,  encryption schemes and cryptograhic primitives.
* A notions page that organizes cryptographical component notes in an accessible manner for IFT CCs 
to get a clear overview or deep dive depending on their needs.

### ZK Think Tank 

* fully qualified name: `vac:acz:ift:2025q1-think-tank:zk-think-tank`
* owner: Marvin
* status: not started
* start-date: 2025/03/03
* end-date: 2025/03/17

#### Description 

Updating the existing documentation of ZK techniques used, developed and researched by IFT teams 
that is accessible and user-friendly to all IFT teams and the broader community. 
This task is important to diffuse the ZK components' how-know across the IFT. 
 
#### Deliverables 

* A notions page to maintain current (and accurate) information on each of IFT's usage of ZK components.
* A notions page that organizes ZK component notes in an accessible manner for IFT CCs 
to get a clear overview or deep dive depending on their needs.
