## Vac 2025/06/30

### highlights
- p2p: Implementation of GossipSub 1.4 is complete, and only final checks are pending
- p2p: Improved performance of Yamux by creating a zero allocation queue (this is to be used in other parts of nim-libp2p)
- dst: Regression test for Nwaku v0.36
- Deployed SN Yield Bridge contracts to the current devnet 
- Released RLN prover module for Status L2 with static storage.
- Achivement two big steps on de-MLS such as separating commit and proposal and having queue for group changes.

### vac:p2p:
- `ift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements`
    - Completed [performance comparison blogpost](https://github.com/vacp2p/vac.dev/pull/169)
    - Work on gossipsub 1.4 PR:
        -  fixed a bug reported by Farooq
        -  added test units for new code
        -  hid gossipsub 1.4 under compile flag: `-d:libp2p_gossipsub_1_4`. This flag is temporary, once
           code is mature/tested we can remove the flag and make gossipsub_1_4 available always
        - Completed production implementation. Doing final checks.	
- `vac:p2p:acz:2025q2-acz-consulting:libp2p-mix-consulting`
    - Propose ideas to debug the discrepancies in the results of mix testing done by DST
