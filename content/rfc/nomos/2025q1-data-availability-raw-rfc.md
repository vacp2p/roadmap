`ift:rfc:2025q1-nomos:data-availability-raw-rfc`

Continuing the process of documentation for the raw RFC for Nomos Data 
Availability (DA).

## Description

This commitment supports delivering a raw RFC for Nomos Data Availability (DA) 
through discussions, support, and inquiries. 

The RFC will focus on DA in Nomos as its initial implementation is ongoing. 
This RFC will be split into different sub-protocols:

- Dispersal 
- Replication
- Samping

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to be a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture, we aim to incentivize projects to apply their 
  RFCs to the team of rfc-editors.
- We aim for the broader web3 community to use our RFCs within their projects 
  and ecosystems, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
