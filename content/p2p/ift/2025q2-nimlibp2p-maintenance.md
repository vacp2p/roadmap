Maintain nim-libp2p through improvements, bug fixes, and user support

## Description

Continue supporting and maintaining the nim-libp2p repository through ongoing improvements, refactoring, and bug fixes.
This includes a range of ad-hoc tasks critical to sustaining code quality, overall stability, correct functionality,
and performance of the project.
Additionally, it provides a platform for addressing small developer requests,
ensuring that nim-libp2p remains functional and usable for its primary users — Nimbus and Waku — helping to meet their evolving needs."

#### Description
The current implementation of nim-libp2p includes abstractions that are difficult to understand, which makes 
development and collaboration more challenging. Refactoring the codebase would improve clarity, allowing 
contributors to grasp the code more easily. Additionally, a more streamlined implementation would enhance 
maintainability, leading to more efficient troubleshooting and debugging.
