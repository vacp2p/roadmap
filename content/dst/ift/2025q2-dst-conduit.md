## Description
Identify and report how IFT projects can scale.
Examine the reports to identify patterns related to the scaling behavior.
Compare results across different project and sizes.
Identify potential bottlenecks or limitations that can arise when scaling.
Understanding these scaling principles 
can highlight cooperation between different projects.

### Background
An examination of the scaling dynamics
of IFT projects can reveal how these initiatives 
benefit from large-scale deployments.
Understanding these scaling principles
can highlight opportunities for cooperation between different projects.
This perspective promotes the sharing
of insights, tools, and strategies, improving cross-project collaboration.
Ultimately, such large-scale deployment strategies 
can lead to more robust and interconnected project outcomes.

### Narratives
We will support the Conduit of Expertise by doing tasks
that optimize resource usage withing the IFT ecosystem.
Also, the insights found can be shared across projects, 
reinforcing cross project collaboration.
We are also in alignment with the Premier Research Destination
by sharing these insights externally. 
This can help VAC build trust and transparency.
