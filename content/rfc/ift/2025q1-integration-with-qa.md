`vac:rfc:ift:2025q1-integration-with-qa`

This commitment involves integration
and closer coordination with the QA team.

## Description

This commitment involves integration
and closer coordination with the QA team
in order to keep track of updates across all projects.
More precisely, we intend to have a shared repository of information
checked regularly where we can update the existing documentation
with the latest information based on knowledge sharing.

**IMPORTANT**: Still being discussed, not final.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team aims to become a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By demonstrating the value of the RFC process, we want future projects
- to submit their RFCs to our team of rfc-editors.
- One of our goals is for the broader web3 community to use our RFCs in their 
  projects and ecosystems, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
