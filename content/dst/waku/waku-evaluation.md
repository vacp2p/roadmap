## Description
Test Waku on a regular basis
and look for regressions,
learn scaling properties and run scaling studies,
understand the limits of Waku and its behaviour.

We want to learn specific, actionable information
about Waku's behaviour
and how it is evolving over time
with each new release
and with each thing we are specifically asked to check and test.

We will use a combination of real world testing,
theoretical analysis and simulation
to determine and measure the success,
side effects and other factors of Waku and its evolution.

We will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative directly
by analysing and evaluating new Waku releases and their features,
both with regards to features they have today
and with regards to how that compares to past behaviour.

We will:

* Enable improvements to Waku
  by allowing for repeatable, measureable
  and real world insights into Waku,
  all the way from theory to practice and back.
* Reduce the risk of a Waku regression
  making it into a new release of Waku.

Additionally, these efforts will contribute
to the Premier Research destination narrative by:

* Improving and strengthening our relationship with the Waku team
  and improving the quality and reputation of IFT's work, inside
  and outside of Waku.

### Regression testing (recurring)

* fully qualified name: <vac:dst:waku:waku-evaluation:regression-testing>
* owner: Alberto
* status: Ongoing
* start-date: 2024-10-01
* end-date: 2024-12-31

#### Description
Run different scenarios
and collect evidence and data
of Waku's behaviour.

Test for known regressions
that have occurred in the past
and ensure they don't happen again.

#### Deliverables
* Analysis done
* Report published with all relevant details
* Vac Roadmap updated regularly
  with links to the analysis and results.
