Iteration commitments generally comprise:
through discussion and curation,
support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected Logos RFCs
as well as upskilling efforts of our and other project teams.

## Description

This commitment supports the process of the writing raw RFCs,
from the existing documentation and specifications.
We will also include specification validation - 
editorial work through previous and future RFCs to improve them
(identify edge cases for example)
as well as making sure that the relevant document has enough information
in order to ease the developer experience for coming developers.

This commitment also involves the upskilling of the RFC team,
1 day weekly effort as well as helping other teams in their upskilling efforts.
