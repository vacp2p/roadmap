helping to study feasibility of different scenarios, and 
also being able to compare them with real experiments."

## Description
Conduct theoretical analysis of various IFT projects
to explore their feasibility, limitations, and potential outcomes.
By modeling different scenarios and comparing theoretical expectations
with real-world experiments, we can refine our understanding
and guide future research directions. 
This work ensures that projects are grounded in solid theoretical foundations
before moving to practical implementation.

### Background
Theoretical analysis plays a critical role in scientific research,
providing a structured approach to evaluating ideas before they are tested experimentally. 
By analyzing different models, assumptions, and constraints, 
we can identify key challenges early on and optimize experimental designs.
This process helps save resources, minimize risks, 
and increase the likelihood of meaningful discoveries. 
Furthermore, comparing theoretical results with experimental data
allows for continuous refinement, leading to more accurate predictions and insights.

### Narratives
Conduit of Expertise: Sharing theoretical insights with the community 
fosters a culture of rigorous scientific discussion, 
allowing researchers to challenge and improve upon each otherâ€™s work.
Open dialogue and peer review strengthen the foundation of our research efforts.
Premier Research of Destination: A strong theoretical framework
enhances the credibility and depth of our research, 
ensuring that projects are built on well-reasoned analysis.
