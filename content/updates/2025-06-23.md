## Vac 2025/06/23

### highlights
- nim-libp2p: Fixed yamux session close so streams are closed instead of reset
- dst: Reproduced bug in mix implementation, notified developers
- dst: confirmed IDONTWANT fixes have no negative effect on nimlibp2p performance
- Rebased our work on the Status Network Yield Bridge contracts on top of the latest changes of the upstream the Linea repo.

    - Worked on performance comparison blogpost. Will try to complete the first draft today
    - [nim-libp2p#1488](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1448) feat: GossipSub 1.4
        - Worked on production implementation:
            - Added logic to store the preambles both in a table and a minheap to make it easier to retrieve expired preambles
            - Keep track of list of peers who could receive an IWANT to query for missing messages
            - Fixed some TODOs
    - Worked on Message rotation/Stream prioritization.

    - Technical discussion with ACZ CC regarding modifying Mix / Gossipsub with the idea of decoupling it more from mix by having new functions that could be used to obtain the serialized RPC `Message` and another function that could be used by an exit node to broadcast the serialized message.
    - Went over mix repository and gave suggestions to ACZ on things that could be improved in code
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-autotls
