## Description

Test and validate the reliability of the Waku RLN Smart Contract in accordance to [Waku2 RLN Contract Specification](https://github.com/waku-org/specs/blob/master/standards/core/rln-contract.md).   
Ensure the smart contract main workflow is functional. Test corner cases and potential attack vectors.   
Test on selected blockchains to ensure uniform behavior across different deployments.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- By testing the Waku RLN Smart Contract,
  VAC QA ensures robust and predictable behavior across different deployments and blockchains.
- This initiative supports VACâ€™s commitment to building reliable and scalable testing frameworks
  that foster collaboration and confidence in the Waku ecosystem.
- Reliability-focused testing directly aligns with the strategic objective of ensuring resilience in communication protocols.
