`vac:qa:waku:2025q2-waku-go-bindings-testing`

## Description
Expand protocol coverage for `waku-go-bindings` with filter and lightpush tests.

The framework should cover those protocols as they are covered in `waku-interop-tests`

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

* The VAC QA team plays a key role in supporting internal collaboration
  and efficiency across projects by ensuring the quality of Nwaku Go Bindings
  and the sunsetting of go-waku.
* By finding issues in specs during testing,
  VAC strengthens the RFC culture,
  contributing to continuous improvement and community engagement.

## Task List

### Filter Protocol Testing

* fully qualified name: `vac:qa:waku:2025q2-waku-go-bindings-testing:filter`
* owner: aya
* status: not started
* start-date: 
* end-date: 

#### Description
Add test coverage by implementing tests for the filter protocol.
These tests should mirror the approach used in `waku-interop-tests`
and ensure reliable message propagation across multiple nodes.

#### Deliverables
PRs and issues

### Lightpush Protocol Testing

* fully qualified name: `vac:qa:waku:2025q2-waku-go-bindings-testing:lightpush`
* owner: aya
* status: not started
