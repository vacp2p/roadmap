`ift:rfc:vac:2025q1-rfc-culture-establishment`

Creating a plan in Notion, compiling information about the RFC process,
publishing a forum post, initially informing and discussing with teams
within the IFT ecosystem.

## Description

This commitment involves continuation
of the RFC culture implementation
through implementing the following:
- Introduction of discussion boards (through forum posts and Discord) to discuss new RFC creation/requirements
- Integration and closer coordination with the QA team in order to keep track of updates
- Specification validation - editorial work through previous and future RFCs to improve them (identify edge cases for example)
- Continued discussion on identifying new RFCs from existing documentation

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team aims to become a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By demonstrating the value of the RFC process, we want future projects
- to submit their RFCs to our team of rfc-editors.
- One of our goals is for the broader web3 community to use our RFCs in their 
  projects and ecosystems, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
