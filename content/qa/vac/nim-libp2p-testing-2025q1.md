`vac:qa:vac:nim-libp2p-testing-2025q1`

## Description
Extend nim-libp2p testing coverage, documentation, and tooling.

Create test plans, implement tests, and increase coverage for all the
[modules](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p?tab=readme-ov-file#modules)
implemented in nim libp2p.
Improve tooling around nim libp2p testing.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
- Nim-libp2p is a key component of the VAC ecosystem,
  and improving its testing coverage and tooling strengthens our internal expertise
  and the overall reliability of the network.
- By enhancing these tests, and creating test plans,
  we support the RFC culture by providing feedback to the specifications,
  ensuring they align with real-world implementation.
- These efforts also contribute to scaling the project’s capacity,
  as better testing tools empower the open-source community to participate effectively.
