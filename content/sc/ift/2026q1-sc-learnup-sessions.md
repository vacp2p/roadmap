Monthly learn up sessions about smart contract development, protocols, security and alike.

## Description

The smart contract service unit is running a monthly learn up session about protocols,
Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and similar topics related to smart contract development and security.
The goal is to learn more about the Ethereum ecosystem and to discuss the presented topics with the team and anyone else who wants to join.

By organizing these presentations and having discussions that are open to the entire IFT organization,
the smart contracts team fosters a culture of knowledge sharing and continuous learning across teams,
improving cross-project collaboration.
