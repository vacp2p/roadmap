## Description

This commitment involves ongoing maintenance and support for previously delivered web projects across the IFT ecosystem. The Web unit ensures continued functionality, security updates, performance optimization, and compatibility management for all web applications, websites, and tools delivered in previous quarters.

The maintenance commitment supports IFT's strategic objectives by:
- **Project Sustainability**: Ensuring delivered projects remain functional and secure over time
- **User Experience Continuity**: Maintaining high-quality user experiences across all web properties
- **Technical Debt Management**: Addressing issues and improvements that emerge post-launch
- **Resource Planning**: Providing clear allocation for ongoing support work
