- `ift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements`
    - Worked on GossipSub v1.4 production implementation. First [PR is here](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1448).
		- Still need to add safety strategy (Will need 1-2 days more).	
- `vac:p2p:acz:2025q2-acz-consulting:libp2p-mix-consulting`
    - Had a pair session with Ben from ACZ going over the libp2p changes for mix.
    - Gave some tips on how to improve the code
    - We went over the publish / receive logic of gossipsub. Suggested to use a set of fixed node keys to make it easier to debug issues with mix
    - Troubleshoot the custom connections PR to see why Gossipsub tests were failing. Found the issue and suggested fix (wrong method signature)
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-kad-dht:routing-and-rpc`
    - Did a small refactoring over the kad-dht code to separate the concept of keys and peerIds in the routing table

    - investigated [nim-libp2p#1367](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1367): hole punching interop tests stopped working
        - was able to run hp tests locally, with suprisngly small effort
        - no other libp2p implementation has this implemented and working
            - rust have this tests but are failing
            - other implementations don't have these tests
        - notified libp2p discord communiti; raising concerns
        - suggestion: to postpone with futher efforts on making this work untill tests are fixed or there is some other implementation with working tests

    - Worked with Ivan from Waku on [nim-libp2p#1438](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1438)
        - The purpose was trying to figure out if a Future was not being completed. 
        - Ended up closign the PR due to not understanding correctly the behavior of the 
          `connectedFut`future when writing the PR so the solution was incorrect and not needed
    - [libp2p/test-plan#656](https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/pull/656): update transport-interop to v1.10.x

    - Managed to run the prometheus metrics with libp2p. Still trying to figure out what's up with nim-libp2p memory usage when using quic. I might need to run pprof equivalent for nim, as nim-metrics does not display any useful metric
- Troubleshoot nim-chronicles breaking things downstream
        - Spent a lot of time with Ben and Akshaya trying to get couple of projects to compile
