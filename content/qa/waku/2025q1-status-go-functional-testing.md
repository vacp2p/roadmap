`vac:qa:waku:2025q1-status-go-functional-testing`

## Description
Collaborate with the Status QA team to improve functional testing coverage by adding new tests outlined in this [epic](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/6064). 
Additionally, work on enhancing the framework to support more advanced functional testing scenarios as these tests are implemented.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
- By helping create a robust functional testing framework for Status Go,
  VAC QA contributes directly to the narrative of internal collaboration and efficiency.
- By finding issues in the project code and specs during testing,
  VAC QA strengthens the RFC culture, contributing to continuous improvement and community engagement.
