- `state-separation-architecture-poc:validium`
    - Tried to run Nomos validium example on my machine anddid not succeeded. Also tried to run the local testnet and if was so difficult. Contacted Nomos and spent a significant amount of time to solve the issue. Problem is that they don't have an image for macOs and had to configure mostly everything manually.
    - Worked with Sergio on understanding how sovreign rollup examples are built and implemented in Nomos. Went through some documentation and code figured out how it works.
    - Went through Celestia to understand how DA works.
    - Wrote a small [document](https://www.notion.so/zkSync-Era-Validium-27f8f96fb65c803c9939c1e56f141313?source=copy_link) about Validium, Nomos, and result interpretation.

- `state-separation-architecture-poc:cpc`
    - Researched how to make cross program calls work on NSSA. Finally, came up with a high level way to do it and discussed it briefly with Sergio.
    - Worked on expanding the idea and the plan is to have a first version next week.
    - Dived into the details of the Nomos [validium](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-example-validium) and [rollup](https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-example-sovereign-rollup) examples.
    - Ran a Nomos local testnet and learned how to disperse data into NomosDA.

- `vac:nes:2025q3:state-separation-architecture-poc:wallet-2`
    - Addressed the comments of PR 115 discussion in PR 119. While doing so I discovered some bugs and issues. Proposals to fix them are in 
        - [PR 119](https://github.com/vacp2p/nescience-testnet/pull/119): wallet improvements and some protocol deviation fixes,
        - [PR 120](https://github.com/vacp2p/nescience-testnet/pull/120): inflation bug stemming from a missing check in the privacy circuit,  and
        - [PR 121](https://github.com/vacp2p/nescience-testnet/pull/121): account uniqueness for private accounts mechanism.
