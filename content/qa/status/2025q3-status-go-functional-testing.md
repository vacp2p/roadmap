`vac:qa:status:2025q3-status-go-functional-testing`

## Description
Expand functional and e2e testing for status-go by implementing tests using status-backend,
as outlined in this [epic](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/6064). 

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
* By helping create a robust functional testing framework for Status Go,
  VAC QA contributes directly to the narrative of internal collaboration and efficiency.
* By finding issues in the project code and specs during testing,
  VAC QA strengthens the RFC culture, contributing to continuous improvement and community engagement.
