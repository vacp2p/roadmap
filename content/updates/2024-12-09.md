## Vac 2024/12/09

### vac:p2p:
- `ift:gossipsub-perf-improvements`
  - Worked on staggered message sending article. Only results and discussion section is left. Need one more day to finalize it.
  - Participated in libp2p specs meeting. The participants seemed convinced and willing for further discussions in broader community.
	- Still need to decide versioning mechanism ([Created an issue on libp2p specs repo](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/649))  
- `vac:libp2p-mix-consulting`
    - Assist in compilation issues, 
    - Brainstorm possible solutions to using mix as a custom transport
    - Create [custom transport PoC](https://github.com/vacp2p/go-transport-experiment):
        - Developed using go-libp2p for faster iteration (due to lack of experience in nim-libp2p at the moment)
        - Demonstrates how to create a transport that uses a libp2p protocol for communication
- `vac:de-mls-consulting`
    - Troubleshoot why messages were not being broadcasted succesfully and suggest changes in how pubsub topics are used

The current waku-rust-bindings are outdated (using go-waku) so once they're updated with nwaku it is necesary to revisit the code
