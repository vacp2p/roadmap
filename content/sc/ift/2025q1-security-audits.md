`vac:sc:ift:2025q1-security-audits`

Participating in security audit contests to get better at building secure applications.
## Description

In the long-term,
we want to be able to conduct security audits in-house for both,
IFT projects and third-party projects.
To get there,
we need to practice and learn from the best.
We aim for participating in one security audit contest this quarter,
if the circumstances allow it.
Urgent work related to IFT projects take precedence over this.
