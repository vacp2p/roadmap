`vac:dst:waku:2025q2-waku-tooling`

## Description

We will create tools that allow
DST and Waku teams to analyze and test
Waku scaling properties.
This includes tooling like a general lor parser,
a black-box bandwidth monitor, and other
utilities that may appear 
depending on the needs of the projects.

### Background

### Narratives

These efforts will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative by
accelerating Waku Improvements,
providing measurable insights
to enhance developer experience
within and beyond the IFT ecosystem.
Also, ideally these tools can be shared across projects, 
reinforcing cross project collaboration.
