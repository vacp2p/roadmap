Exploring Kademlia DHT and Discv5 to identify promising research directions
## Description
This commitment entails exploring discovery mechanisms such as 
[Kademlia DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) and [DiscV5](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5.md) 
for peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, with a focus on identifying areas for improvement in latency, 
the anonymity-discoverability tradeoff, security, and scalability. 
We aim to explore these protocols not only to evaluate their current performance 
but also to identify promising research directions—particularly in enhancing anonymity within DHTs, 
improving the efficiency of peer discovery, and assessing the overall capabilities and limitations of these approaches. 
Additionally, the exploration includes assessing their suitability for IFT projects. 

### Narratives

By utilizing discovery exploration commitment, 
we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Providing know-how about latest improvements on discovery mechanisms 
that will be tailored for many IFT teams such as Waku, Nomos, and Codex. 

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:
* Offers open source information such as blogposts and forum posts 
that show the potential improvement points of the discovery mechanism.

## Task List

### Exploring Discovery

* fully qualified name: `vac:acz:ift:2025q3-discovery-exploration:exploring`
* owner: Arunima
* status: started (80%)
* start-date: 2025/09/01
* end-date: 2025/09/15

#### Description

This task involves researching and evaluating peer-to-peer (P2P) discovery mechanisms, 
specifically Kademlia DHT and DiscV5. 
The objective is to uncover promising research directions and assess the protocols’ 
suitability for IFT projects, with documented findings

#### Deliverables

* A [notion document](https://www.notion.so/Improving-EGN-Discovery-protocol-DRAFT-2638f96fb65c8082a4dfe9f2aefaf8bc) contains promising research directions.

### Disc-NG Specs

* fully qualified name: `vac:acz:ift:2025q3-discovery-exploration:disc-ng-specs`
* owner: Arunima
* status: started (0%)
* start-date: 2025/09/15
* end-date: 2025/09/30

#### Description

This task is the first in a series of tasks aimed at specifying the [disc-NG](https://sonnino.com/papers/disc-ng.pdf) paper.
During this task, the disc-NG protocol will be evaluated in terms of implementability,
and any existing gaps will be identified. The implementable parts will be drafted in RFC format.

#### Deliverables

* A [notion document](https://www.notion.so/Improving-EGN-Discovery-protocol-DRAFT-2638f96fb65c8082a4dfe9f2aefaf8bc) contains promising research directions.
