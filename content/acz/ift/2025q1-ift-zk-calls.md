### Background

These meetings will be conducted with the participation 
of all individuals involved with ZK within IFT. 
Topics are chosen from the latest improvements from literature 
and the IFT.

By utilizing this commitment, 

we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Sync the monthly ZK improvements with all shares in IFT.
