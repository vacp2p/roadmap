## Description
> *Note*: This needs more input from project

Use real world testing,
theoretical analysis
and simulation
to determine and improve Nomos's scaling properties.
Find the limits of Nomos's capabilities
and measure them in different scenarios.

We will measure the real world speeds and latency of Nomos' mixnet,
and what use cases it is therefore able to support.

The scope of this commitment depends on the Nomos team
work and improvements, and it is subjected to change.

### Background

### Narratives

We will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative directly
by providing valuable insights to Nomos
and the ability to theorise, reason about,
test, measure and improve
the performance, stability and scalability of Nomos.

These efforts will contribute in these ways to the Conduit of Expertise narrative:

* Help Nomos ship a more scalable mixnet,
  unlocking capabilities across IFT's teams and ecosystem
  and allowing for more use cases to be supported and understood.
This will also help spur on outside adoption and contributions.
* Improve the RFC culture
  by allowing for faster and easier development of RFCs
  with the aid of rapidly accelerated insights into how an RFC in development will perform as it's being expanded and going through the draft process.
* Allow easier post-mortem analysis of the success or relative performance of a given RFC
