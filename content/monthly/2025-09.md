### P2P

#### highlights

- AutonatV2 development is complete
- Mix code has been merged in nim-libp2p
- Added options in gossipsub to choose whether the Preamble and IDontWant control messages should be sent when publishing a message
- Release [v1.13.0](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/releases/tag/v1.13.0)
#### report

- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q3-nimlibp2p-maintenance:maintenance`
	- Overview:
        - `maintenance`
            - Release [v1.13.0](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/releases/tag/v1.13.0) of nim-libp2p
            - Fixed missing imports in daily job
            - Fixed a bug in parameter order when adding Yamux that caused the max possible number of streams per peer to be 256000
            - Improvements in Quic on performance, memory usage, and code simplification
        - `flaky-tests`
            - Reenabled temporarily the hole punching interop tests to investigate reason behind its failures
            - Noticed that these tests hardcode the circuit relay server to be rust-libp2p
            - Local Unit tests for circuit relay as well as usage of circuit relay in Waku makes us think that the problem is due to the test setup or rust-libp2p
            - Due to other priorities, and due to the fact that this same test fails in rust-libp2p CI, we suspended the investigation
        - `go-libp2p-daemon`
            - Removed the usage of [go-libp2p-daemon](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-daemon) as part of our unit tests
                - It is not maintained
                - Functionality is already covered via interop and unit tests
                - No need for an additional toolchain, and also improves the CI speed
	- Delivered deliverables:
		- Maintenance work is being tracked in [Maintenance 2025Q3](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/issues/1509)
