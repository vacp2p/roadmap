  - Completed nim-libp2 GossipSub v1.2, v1.4, v1.4+stagger_send performance comparisons
  - Worked on go-libp2p GossipSub v1.2, v2.0 performance comparisons

	- V2.0 implementation halts on large messages/network size. Evaluations are done for small messages/network size
		- Looking into possible options for resolving this
