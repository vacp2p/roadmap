- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q3-nimlibp2p-mix:mix-core`
    - [vacp2p/mix#73](https://github.com/vacp2p/mix/pull/73) feat: create surbs and send response back
        - From the flow described in [#41](https://github.com/vacp2p/mix/issues/41#issuecomment-3188746709) implemented:
            - Sender-side flow (Entry)
            - Exit-side flow (Sending Reply)
            - Currently working on Sender-Side Flow (Receiving Reply) 
        - Refactor the entry layer to make it easier to understand whether exit is destination or not
        - Added `proc registerFwdBehavior*(mixProto: MixProtocol, codec: string, fwdBehavior: fwdBehaviorCb)` which lets you customize the read behavior in the exit node, for cases in which exit is not destination.

    - Resumed Section 8 refactor in PR [PR #173](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/pull/173).
    - Began adding payload encryption and handler logic (WiP).
- `ift:2025q3-libp2p-mix-testnet:multi-surb-design`
    - Encountered issues running Mixnet with `nim-libp2p v2.2.4`.
    - Debugged Sphinx reply processing: destination was incorrectly embedded in final hop.
    - Implemented SURB handling changes in [feat/surbs-process branch]( https://github.com/vacp2p/mix/tree/feat/surbs-process).

- `ift:2025q3-zerokit:libp2p-mix-repo`
    - Synced with P2P team on achieving uniform behavior in Mix core regardless of `exit != destination` or not.
    - Aligned that hop selection remains a challenge: in `exit == destination`, the last hop must be the destination, which introduces a special case.
    - Discussed options: either expose hop selection to top-level applications or allow Mix core to be aware of the destination — both are not desirable.
    - Explored possibility of defining a custom client-relay protocol for GossipSub (suggested by Richard) to avoid this.
