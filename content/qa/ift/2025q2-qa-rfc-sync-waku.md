`vac:qa:ift:2025q2-qa-rfc-sync-waku`

## Description
Building on the previous quarter's efforts, 
this commitment focuses on systematically reviewing each IFT-related repository 
to ensure protocol implementations match the corresponding RFCs. 
Any discrepancies will be flagged for either:
1. RFC updates (in collaboration with the RFC team), or 
2. Bug fixes/additional work in the respective repositories.

As part of this process, we will also assess the level of test automation and coverage for each protocol, 
identifying gaps and proposing or creating additional tests as necessary.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
* Continues fostering collaboration between QA, RFC contributors, and engineering teams, ensuring changes in one area promptly reflect across the ecosystem.
* Helps maintain a high standard for both internal and external contributions by detecting discrepancies early and closing testing gaps.

## Task List

### nwaku

* fully qualified name: `vac:qa:ift:2025q2-qa-rfc-sync-waku:nwaku`
* owner: fbarbu15
