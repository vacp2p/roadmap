`vac:qa:waku:2025q2-status-go-functional-testing`

## Description
Expand functional testing for status-go by implementing targeted Waku feature tests, 
including chat actions, contact requests, and group chats, 
as outlined in this [epic](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/6064). 

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
* By helping create a robust functional testing framework for Status Go,
  VAC QA contributes directly to the narrative of internal collaboration and efficiency.
* By finding issues in the project code and specs during testing,
  VAC QA strengthens the RFC culture, contributing to continuous improvement and community engagement.
