### Devnet

* fully qualified name: `ift-ts:dst:blockchain:2026q1-blockchain-evaluation:devnet`
* owner: Alberto
* status: in progress (50%)
* start-date: 2026/02/17
* end-date: 2026/03/05

#### Description

Assist blockchain team in running devnet experiments. Use the lab to support more nodes
and help with debugging issues.

#### Deliverables
* Github:
  - [Github Repo: Identify-Probe](https://github.com/vacp2p/identify-probe)
  - [Github PR: fix(docker): Dockerfile fix for new releases #2214](https://github.com/logos-blockchain/logos-blockchain/pull/2214)

## Description
> *Note*: This needs more input from project

Use real world testing,
theoretical analysis
and simulation
to determine and improve Blockchain's scaling properties.
Find the limits of Blockchain's capabilities
and measure them in different scenarios.

We will measure the real world speeds and latency of Blockchain' mixnet,
and what use cases it is therefore able to support.

The scope of this commitment depends on the Blockchain team
work and improvements, and it is subjected to change.
