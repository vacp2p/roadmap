## Description

This commitment involves supporting the continued development of the Status App by ensuring that web applications, interfaces, and extensions remain functional and compatible during native app upgrades, refactoring, and protocol improvements.

**The Status App web support will support Status' strategic objectives by:**
- **Compatibility Maintenance**: Ensuring web applications and interfaces remain functional during native app upgrades
- **User Experience Continuity**: Preventing disruption to web-based user experiences during development

**Alignment with IFT Narratives:**
- **Community Co-creation**: Maintaining web tools that enable permissionless community formation and governance
