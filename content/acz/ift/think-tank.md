Publishing a reviewing document for the cryptography modules of IFT projects
## Description

Many IFT projects utilize the cryptography as one of the components their arhictecture. As ACZ team, 
we collect all the cryptographical primitives into single commitment, review and compare them to detect potential 
improvable and strong aspects.


By utilizing the think-tant commitment, 
we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Create a document describing the review and compare cryptographic modules for each of Waku, 
Status, Codex, and Nimbus.
* Share the common know-how with the relevant project if needed.

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by: 
* Present the significant cryptographic findings on the [VAC forum](https://forum.vac.dev/) 
to initiate discussions and contribute to the benefit of the ecosystem.
