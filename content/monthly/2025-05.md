### Nescience  
#### Highlights  
- Revised all Q1 research tasks output and drafted some conclusion to take decisions regarding several aspects of the architecture, mainly: shielded executions, deshielded executions, privacy flags, UTXOs, and nullifiers.
- Improved the UTXO model (research) and updated its implementation (engineering).
- Started exploring account-based model and started sketching their integration into NSSA.
- Started formalizing NSSA components.
- Engineering wise, implemented private smart contract state model, private state provability, and methods for sc. 
- Also implemented persistent state storage in datebase, stable seriallization for sparse Merkle trees and snapshooting mechanisms.
- Result-wise, we have improved our architecture components by focusing on the UTXO model, the SE and DE models, and acoount-based model for NSSA. Our code was also improved by adding a lot of functionalities and features matching the conducted research.


#### Report  
- `vac:nes:state-separation-architecture-poc`  
    - Overview:  
        - Improved our UTXO model by removing the use of true privacy flags and adding a consistent representation of value.
        - Improved SE and DE models by opting to use single-stage models instead of two-stage models.
        - Improved circuit computation by removing non-membership proofs from circuit in a way that the circuit does not have to re-run big proofs when needed.
        - Investigated Ethereum, Aztec, and Solana token accounts and started sketching integration of Ethereum and Solana's accounts into NSSA.
        - Started investigating linkability issues.
        - Implemented private smart contract state model, private state provability, methods for sc. 
        - Also implemented persistent state storage in datebase, stable seriallization for sparse Merkle trees, migration from Sparse Merkle Tree into HashSet for nullifiers, snapshooting mechanism at node, periodic snapshooting mechanism and start from snapshot block.
