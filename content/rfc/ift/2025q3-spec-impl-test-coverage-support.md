`vac:rfc:ift:2025q3-spec-impl-test-coverage-support`

This commitment involves supporting the QA team
with feedback
and precise information revolving spec updates, issues and problems
as well as being the bridge (in terms of specs) between the QA team
and relevant project teams.

## Description

The Vac QA team is conducting a comprehensive review of our IFT projects,
focusing on three key areas:
Specification (RFC), Implementation, and Test Coverage.
Our goal is to ensure that all aspects of these projects are thoroughly specified,
properly implemented, and have complete test coverage.
This document will highlight any gaps or areas for improvement in this process.

Relevant/connected QA commitment: [[qa/ift/2025q2-qa-rfc-sync-waku|2025q2-qa-rfc-sync-waku]]

The RFC team commits to supporting this process:

- Informing the QA team about spec updates.
- Making adjustments to specs where the QA finds errors.
- Informing the relevant project teams where the specs need to be updated
and the nature of the update (error, inconsistency, etc.).
- Where necessary, adding proposals to improving the process
(subject to changes).

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team aims to become a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By demonstrating the value of the RFC process, we want future projects
- to submit their RFCs to our team of rfc-editors.
- One of our goals is for the broader web3 community to use our RFCs in their 
  projects and ecosystems, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
