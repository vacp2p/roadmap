Maintaining by the updating the recent developments in 
cryptography and ZK modules of IFT projects
## Description
This commitment entails maintaining an up-to-date repository 
of cryptography and zero-knowledge (ZK) topics from all IFT teams such as 
Waku, Nomos, Codex and Status, serving as a knowledge base for teams 
requiring expertise in these areas while also minimizing overlapping.

### Background
Many IFT projects utilize the cryptography as one of the components their architecture. 
As ACZ team, we collect all the cryptographical and ZK primitives into single commitment, 
review and compare them to detect potential improvable and strong aspects.

### Narratives
By utilizing the think-tank commitment, 
we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Create a document describing the review and compare cryptographic modules for each of Waku, 
Status, Codex, and Nimbus.
* Maintain the ZK think tank document review and compare ZK modules for each of Waku, 
Status, Codex, and Nimbus.
* Share the common know-how with the relevant project if needed.

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by: 
* Present the significant cryptographic findings on the [VAC forum](https://forum.vac.dev/) 
to initiate discussions and contribute to the benefit of the ecosystem.

## Task List

### Maintain-1

* fully qualified name: `vac:acz:ift:2025q2-think-tank:maintain-1`
* owner: Marvin
* status: started
* start-date: 2025/04/01
* end-date: 2025/04/14

#### Description 

Updating the think-tank Notion page with up-to-date improvements such as cryptographic techniques 
developed and researched by IFT teams, in particular Nimbus and Waku.
This task is important to diffuse the cryptographic components' how-know across the IFT. 

#### Deliverables 

* A document to notion page with latest improvements.

### Maintain-2
