`vac:qa:waku:2025q1-direct-message-reliability-testing`

## Description
Focus on testing and validating the reliability of direct messages in Status chat protocols, 
including 1:1 chats and private groups in accordance to Waku FURPS.
This includes testing flows under degraded network conditions, 
ensuring message retrieval after reconnections, 
and validating the application of MVDS for improved message delivery reliability.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

* By ensuring the reliability of direct messaging, 
  VAC QA contributes to a more robust and user-friendly experience within Status applications.
* Testing efforts provide valuable insights into potential issues, 
  supporting VACâ€™s goal of improving communication protocols and collaboration.
* This initiative directly aligns with strategic objectives 
  to ensure resilience and consistent performance in communication tools.
