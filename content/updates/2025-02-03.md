## Vac 2025/02/03

### vac:p2p:
- `ift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements`
  - Revised staggered message sending article. Some minor fixes are left. Will finish by tonight.
  - Worked on rust-libp2p gossipsub simulation for shadow. Peer connections/data sending working now. 
	- Still facing some issues in peering with message sending. Will need 2-3 days to finalize simulation
- `ift:2025q1-nimlibp2p-wrapping-ngtcp2:tls_handshake`
    - mbedTLS does not yet export the necessary APIs required for the QUIC protocol, so I wrapped picoTLS instead in this [PR](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-ngtcp2/pull/10)
    - noticed that the PR fails in windows, so this [PR](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-ngtcp2/pull/11) applies the necessary changes to add windows support. 
    - currently working on removing the hardcoded behavior to compile windows so that PR can be merged into [#10](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-ngtcp2/pull/10)
- `acz:2025q1-acz-consulting:de-mls-consulting`
    - Troubleshoot connection issues between rust nodes and nwaku node
    - Discuss about how to use discovery with bindings. Will require a change in the bindings to add an attribute to the config to specify bootnodes
- `acz:2025q1-acz-consulting:libp2p-mix-consulting`
    - Figure out compilation error that appeared once using a newer version of nim. The solution was to use the memory management flag `--mm:refc`
    - Review and discuss custom connection approach for mix including possible approach to return the end node response to request originator
- `ift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements`
    - Review staggered message sending paper

    - Open [issue](https://github.com/zkmopro/ark-zkey/issues/1) in ark-zkey lib to adjust their depenecies but it still require checnges and maybe return to mopro library since they remove wasmer patch.
- `ift:2025q1-zerokit-v0-7:rln-wasm`
    - During a version upgrade in zerokit it was discovered that the wasm part doesn't work on the newer version of wasmer. After discussion with Richard, we came to the opinion that either we should deprecate this part altogether, as it was experimental and there is no certainty that it is being used.

    - Discussed with Daniel to outline this quarter's priorities.
    - Explored entry connection abstraction with Richard, identifying challenges:
        - Reqire changes to libp2p switch `dial` function.
        - Protocols expecting responses on the same connection (*e.g.,* Ping) limit protocol-agnostic design.
        - May require updates to send functions in such protocols.
