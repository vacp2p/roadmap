Iteration commitments generally comprise:
through discussion and curation,
support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected RFCs.

## Description

This commitment covers the writing of the following mature RFCs
according to COSS, based on the Notion documentation:
- TBD

We will also include specification validation - 
to make sure there are no errors, missing information, inconsistencies
and that the specification is up to standards.



**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository
for RFCs regarding all IFT projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture,
we hope to incentivize projects to submit their RFCs
to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs
in their projects, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).

## Task List

TBD
