`ift:rfc:vac:culture-establishment-2024q4`

Creating a plan in Notion, compiling information about the RFC process, initial informing of the teams and the discussions with the teams in the IFT ecosystem.
## Description

This commitment revolves around creating a plan through Notion documentation and the start of implementation of RFC culture through communications with the teams in the IFT ecosystem. 

The effort will align with other projects' releases of critical milestones in order to help out with the documentation efforts. It will not prematurely publish information that projects do not wish to disclose beforehand. The initial effort will revolve around creating a task list to drive the communication with the other projects and create a go-to place (on Notion) which will contain sufficient information regarding the culture.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

* The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository for RFCs regarding all the IFT projects.
* By providing information and benefits of the RFC Culture, we want to have projects apply their RFCs to the team of rfc-editors, in the future.
* One of our ideals is to have the broader web3 community utilize our RFCs to potentially implement within their projects and ecosystems (similar to how [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) works).
