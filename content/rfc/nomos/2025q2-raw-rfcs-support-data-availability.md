`vac:rfc:nomos:2025q2-raw-rfcs-support-data-availability`

Supporting the process of creating new RFCs based on DA subprotocols.

## Description

This commitment supports delivering raw RFC
for Nomos Data Availability (DA)
through discussions, support, and inquiries. 

This commitment will focus on the new version of DA
as the v2 research is ongoing.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to be a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture, we aim to incentivize projects to apply their 
  RFCs to the team of rfc-editors.
- We aim for the broader web3 community to use our RFCs within their projects 
  and ecosystems, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
- We plan to give feedback, where applicable, to improve the specifications further.
