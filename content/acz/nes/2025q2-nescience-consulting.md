Creating research documents and specifications 
for Nescience architecture
## Description

ACZ offers review consulting services to Nescience, 
acting as a bridge between Nescience researchers and engineers, 
facilitating faster and more efficient communication between the two groups.

By utilizing the Nescience Consulting commitment, 

we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* The Nescience specifications will be reviewed and refined from an engineering perspective.
* Addressing any potential gaps in the architecture, whether theoretical or practical, 
if any are identified
* Improve communication between Nescience researchers and developers.

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by: 
* This will enable the Nescience project to be more effectively integrated 
and introduced into the ecosystem.

## Task List

### Unifying 2025q1 Documents
* fully qualified name: `vac:acz:nes:2025q2-nescience-consulting:unifying-q1-docs`
* owner: Marvin
* status: done
* start-date: 2024/05/05
* end-date: 2025/05/20

### Description
Nescience has many unstructured documents from 2025q1, this task entails creating a single document 
that covers all these new ideas by removing recurring topics. Also, it includes creating a table for each document
which topics we include or exclude. 


### Deliverables
* A [notion page](https://www.notion.so/1-Single-Unified-Doc-of-2025Q1-Research-1eb8f96fb65c808aa51bd4a9f5e11cc3) that consists of a single unified doc 
* A [table](https://www.notion.so/2-Table-that-what-we-include-or-exclude-1ec8f96fb65c805a8ba6d0221926efff) that shows which topics we include or exclude
* A [notion](https://www.notion.so/3-Recommended-research-directions-1f88f96fb65c800c80e9e4ec5f0e3cae) page that shows decisions need to be made

### SE/DE improvements
* fully qualified name: `vac:acz:nes:2025q2-nescience-consulting:SE-DE-improvements`

* start-date: 2024/05/21
* end-date: 2025/06/04

### Description
In Q1, shielded executions were a primary focus. In this task, we focus on improvements to deshieldedd executions. Specifically,
- Examine deshielded execution kernel circuit for optimisations.
- Design and prototype a mechanism that applies deshielded execution's results to the public state in a consistent and verifiable manner.
- For both DE and SE, design sample transactions to example edge cases (concurrent updates to same public account, ordering issues).

This directly corresponds to Nescience's [Q2-R2](https://www.notion.so/R2-Updating-public-state-with-private-execution-SE-DE-improvements-1bf8f96fb65c81a98548fff27c4d1dcc) task.


### Deliverables
* RFC style documents for SE/DE
