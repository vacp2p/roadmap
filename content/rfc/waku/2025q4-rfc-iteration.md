`vac:rfc:waku:2025q4-rfc-iteration`

Iteration commitments generally comprise:
through discussion and curation,
support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected Waku RFCs.

## Description

This commitment supports the audit of mature RFCs, which are 
either in draft or raw states. The audit comprises of:
- Reading through the spec;
- Checking the relevant codebase;
- Changing the parts of the spec (descriptions and codebase) where applicable;
- Updates of relevant links;
- Changing the RFC status (optional);
- Going through rounds of feedback with the relevant project team;
- Adding clarifications where needed in the spec;
- Checking for inconsistencies with other documentation/codebase.

The following RFCs will be worked on in this quarter:
- Opchan

We will also include specification validation - 
editorial work through previous and future RFCs to improve them
(identify edge cases for example)
