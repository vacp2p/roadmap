`vac:nim:ift:2025q1-nim-ide-tooling`

## Description

The commitment comprises enhancing the Nim IDE experience by focusing on two parallel tracks.

Firstly, we'll prioritize the integration of Araq's upcoming work, specifically the replacement of nimsuggest with gear2, as soon as it becomes available.
This integration will bring improved code intelligence capabilities to our IDE.

Secondly, we'll continue to develop and implement quality-of-life features to boost developer productivity.
These enhancements will include the ability to run tests directly from the extension,
implementing "quick actions" for common tasks, and adding support for macro expansion visualization. 
hile awaiting gear2's completion, we'll maintain and improve nimsuggest, addressing bugs and adding new features to ensure a smooth transition.

By the end of the quarter, we aim to have a more robust, user-friendly Nim IDE with enhanced functionality and improved performance.
