Continuation of RFC Culture establishment
through introducing new initiatives.

## Description

This commitment involves continuation
of the RFC culture implementation
through implementing the following:
- Introduction of discussion boards
(through forum posts and Discord)
to discuss new RFC creation/requirements
- Continued discussion on identifying new RFCs
from existing documentation.
This is done in order to try achieving rough consensus
on which new RFCs are to be made.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team aims
to become a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By demonstrating the value of the RFC process, we want future projects
to submit their RFCs to our team of rfc-editors.
- One of our goals is for the broader web3 community
to use our RFCs in their projects and ecosystems,
similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
