finalizing the de-MLS RFC with consensus integration 
with the multi-admin support and implementing the last version RFC
## Description
This commitment involves completing the de-MLS RFC by incorporating 
multi-administrator configurations with decentralized consensus and implementing it 
with a multi-admin setup over the Waku network. 
The process includes presenting the findings such as MLS over Waku and benchmarking, 
then applying for the EF grant.

### Background
de-MLS is a decentralized, scalable, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) group messaging application 
with Ethereum-based authentication. 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive and mature RFC that outlines 
decentralized, secure, and scalable group key generation, 
designed to accommodate large numbers of users within a single group.

During 2025q1, we removed centralized aspects of the RFC by integrating the 
consensus mechanism among the users for achieving true decentralization. 
Also, we relese the extended implementation that multi-waku node can cooperate.
The implementation plan for this quarter is to extend the initial single admin approach 
to a multi-admin configuration with consensus operating across the Waku network. 

### Narratives
we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Develop the foundational framework for a decentralized, scalable messaging application 
* Research and implement the scalable and decentralized consensus mechanism.

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:
* Develop a standardized decentralized messaging application over the Waku network,
by providing a well-structured RFC and a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates 
its base functionality within the ecosystem. 
This will allow teams and organizations to build their own messaging applications while 
benefiting from these features.
* Create a proposal for the Ethereum Foundation (EF) to apply for EF grants to promote the project and 
gain support from the Ethereum ecosystem.
