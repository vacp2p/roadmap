due to a blocker from Iden3.\r\nAlthough we can move forward, the effort required doesn’t justify it,\r\ngiven the current low priority.\nThe current implementation includes a modified version of the Iden3 witness calculator,\r\nwith changes specifically related to data types. This task involves:\n\nVerifying whether these modifications are truly necessary.\nExploring the feasibility of using the original Iden3 repository as a submodule\r\ninstead of maintaining a separate modified version.\nBenchmarking both solutions to compare their performance and potential impact.\n\nDeliverables §\nA set of PRs and issues to vacp2p/zerokit to cover as follows:\n\nAnalysis of the differences between the current implementation and the original Iden3 witness calculator.\nJustification (or refutation) of the necessity of data type modifications.\nA benchmark comparing the performance of both implementations.\nRecommendation on whether to keep the modified version or use Iden3 as a submodule.\n\nRLN Execution Bottleneck Analysis §\n\nfully qualified name:

operations.\r\nThe problem may stem from two potential sources:\n\nInefficient tree operations within Zerokit, particularly in the function located here.\r\nThe method of reading and parsing input data might be suboptimal.\nInefficiencies within the membership contract itself.\n\nThe issue became apparent when the membership contract reached 270,000 memberships,\r\ncausing extreme slowdowns in processing.\r\nSpecifically, the atomic_write function from librln is a major bottleneck, taking 11 to 30 seconds per call.\r\nSince this function is called within a loop, processing large batches\r\n(e.g., 1752 events per RPC call) results in multi-hour delays.\r\nThis makes syncing infeasible and exposes scalability issues with the current approach.\nThis task involves identifying the actual bottleneck and\r\nmaking at least initial improvements to Zerokit’s tree structure performance.\r\nWe need to Investigate why atomic_write takes so long and whether it can be optimized.\nDeliverables §\nA PR to vacp2p/zerokit incorporating the improvements:\n\nAdding measurements to atomic operations in the existing benchmark\nAnalysis of the tree operations in Zerokit to

Wasmer,\r\nbut it has proven difficult to maintain, slow, and inefficient for parallel computations.\r\nThis task focuses on comparing the existing Wasmer-based approach\r\nwith an alternative implementation based on Iden3’s Wasm solution.\r\nThe goal is to evaluate their performance, compatibility, and maintainability\r\nto determine the best approach for zerokit.\nDeliverables §\nA

vac:acz:ift:2025q2-zerokit:rln-execution-bottleneck,\r\nwe identified an inefficient algorithm used for updating the tree structure.\r\nAlthough improvements were made, there’s still potential for further optimization.\nOne promising approach is to update the hashes incrementally during tree updates,\r\nwhich could reduce redundant computations.\r\nAdditionally, refactoring the current algorithm to leverage the rayon crate for parallelism\r\nmay significantly boost performance—potentially by 20% or more.\r\nThis task involves analyzing the current implementation, applying targeted refactors,\r\nand introducing parallel processing where appropriate.\nDeliverables §\n\nA PR to zerokit and linked to the issue related to release v0.8.0\n\nInvestigate Semaphore §\n\nfully qualified

users to prove membership in a group without revealing their identity.\r\nThis enables anonymous messaging, voting, and other privacy-preserving applications.\r\nIn this task, we aim to evaluate whether replacing the current zero-knowledge proof system makes sense.\r\nTo begin, we will focus on two areas of research:\n\n\nCompare the light-poseidon library\r\nwith our current Poseidon hash implementation\n\nVerify whether the parameters used are the same\nPrepare performance benchmarks\n\n\n\nEvaluate the efficiency of the lean-imt Merkle tree\r\nversus our current Merkle tree implementation\n\nFocus on tree initialization, leaf insertion, proof generation, and proof verification\n\n\n\nCompare the zero-knowledge proof systems themselves\n\n\n\nOnce we understand the relative performance of Poseidon and Merkle tree implementations,\r\nevaluate the zk-proof construction step\nAssess the performance and complexity of generating and verifying proofs\r\nusing the current system versus potential alternatives\n\nFor context, see our previous investigation into Semaphore usage in Zerokit:\nSemaphore README in Zerokit branch\nDeliverables §\nSubmit either a pull request or a comment on this issue\r\nin the Zerokit repository that includes:\n\nBenchmark results for both the Poseidon hash and the Merkle tree implementations\nA summary of findings, including

Zerokit to improve composability with other crates.\r\nThe current use of eyre for error handling might not align with the preferences orinfrastructure of downstream users.\r\nAs zerokit is designed to be a reusable crate,\r\nrelying on a specific error type like eyre::Report may limit flexibility for consumers who prefer using anyhow,\r\ncustom error types, or other error

(20%)\nstart-date: 2025/07/07\nend-date: 2025/07/26\n\nDescription §\nThis task focuses on improving Zerokit’s Continuous Integration (CI)\r\nand build setup to enable more flexible and accurate binary generation. Key objectives include:\n\nIntegrating missing options for generating feature-specific binaries,\r\nand making arkzkey the default feature for improved consistency.\r\nThis will also require creating a script to convert arkzkey from zkey.\nAddressing the current default enablement of the parallel feature within the rln module.\r\nThis was a temporary workaround for a macro expansion issue in graph.rs affecting WASM multithreading.\r\nThe goal is to refactor the feature flags across Zerokit\r\nand its internal dependencies to allow parallel to be optional.\r\nThis cleanup will require a thorough review of all dependent crates\r\nthat internally utilize the parallel flag.\n\nDeliverables §\nA Pull Request to vacp2p/zerokit with updated CI configurations.\nConsistent Naming and Docs

Started\nstart-date:\nend-date:\n\nDescription §\nCurrently, initializing a PmTreeConfig struct for PmTree in Rust requires either\r\nproviding a JSON-formatted string or using the default configuration.\r\nThis approach lacks type safety and compile-time validation,\r\nmaking configuration less ergonomic and more prone to runtime errors.\nThis task aims to improve the PmTreeConfig initialization process by implementing a builder pattern.\r\nThis will allow developers to construct PmTreeConfig instances programmatically with clear,\r\nchained method calls, enhancing readability, type safety, and ease of use,\r\nrather than solely relying on string-based JSON parsing.\nDeliverables §\nA Pull Request to vacp2p/zerokit containing:\n\nA new PmTreeConfigBuilder

We aim to redefine privacy-oriented technologies,\nwhich are often criticized for their sluggish performance, by introducing a fast, intuitive, and developer-friendly approach to state separation.\nFurthermore, we envision the public state serving as a vigilant monitoring layer, safeguarding privacy against any potential ZKP vulnerabilities or attacks,\nthereby assuring users of their data security.\nOur project distinguishes itself by offering a well-defined theoretical representation of state separation,\ncomplete with graphical analyses for a clearer comparison with other privacy-preserving solutions, thus addressing the lack of specificity and clarity in existing models.\nInteractions with the virtual machine (VM) are pivotal, involving two critical junctures.\nInitially, on the user (client) side, transactions that may contain multiple executions, including private, shielded, or deshielded types, are generated as ZK proofs.\nThese proofs, representing each execution, are then amalgamated into a single ZK proof for submission to the sequencer (VM).\nThe sequencer’s role is to aggregate transactions from users, verify the proofs, validate nullifiers for conflict detection,\nand then compile all verified proofs within an epoch to formulate a block.\nThis process also entails adjustments to the public state in response to the varied executions (public modifications, shielded, and deshielded executions).\nThe design criteria for the zkVM include the necessity for high recursion capabilities and sufficient efficiency to ensure usability in terms of memory and computational time on the user side.\nThis requirement is critical for compatibility with complex tasks like concealing certain information within zkVM operations,\naccommodating a significant volume of public and private inputs. The efficiency of verification, even in systems like Groth16 that offer theoretically constant-size verification times,\ncan be affected as the quantity of inputs grows, underscoring the need for a VM architecture that remains practical and responsive under varying loads.\nThis nuanced understanding underscores the project’s comprehensive approach to leveraging state separation for enhanced privacy and scalability,\nall while ensuring compatibility with an advanced zkVM framework.\nThe most significant impact of our state separation approach in the Nescience project lies in its innovative privacy features,\nwhich employ an account-based model for the public state and a UTXO-based model for the private state, allowing for individual or group-specific private states.\nThis method stands out by offering four distinct types of executions: public, private, shielded, and deshielded, each with unique characteristics to maintain privacy and scalability.\nPublic executions are transparent and swift, modifying accounts without the need for Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).\nIn contrast, private, shielded, and deshielded executions, which involve transferring between public and private states or within private states,\nutilize ZKPs to protect sensitive information like addresses, transaction amounts, and smart contract invocations through kernel circuits.\nThese executions are further enriched by allowing transactions to comprise various execution types,\nensuring that sensitive data is processed on the user side with ZKPs to prevent exposure in the public state.\nFor example, transactions involving private tokens or smart contract interactions remain confidential, with minimal information reflected publicly.\nThis architecture addresses potential risks like linkability and double-spending through the innovative use of nullifiers and accumulators, enhancing privacy without sacrificing security.\nOur approach also introduces Private Directed Acyclic Graphs (PDAGs) as a tool for analyzing and enhancing privacy.\nAs an extension of Transaction Directed Acyclic Graphs (TDAGs), PDAGs are specifically designed to address and measure two critical aspects of privacy:\nunlinkability and untraceability. Unlinkability refers to the property that ensures individual transactions cannot be linked to each other,\nmaking it impossible to trace the flow of assets between transactions from an external observer’s perspective.\nThis feature is crucial for protecting user identities and preventing the exposure of transaction histories.\nUntraceability, on the other hand, ensures that it is infeasible to trace transactions back to their source or destination,\nproviding a further layer of privacy by obscuring the relationship between senders and receivers.\nThis means that, even if an entity were to observe the network, they would not be able to determine the parties involved in any given transaction.\nPDAGs incorporate these principles by structuring transaction records in a way that leverages the benefits of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),\na type of data structure that allows for efficient data management and retrieval without the limitations of linear or hierarchical arrangements.\nIn the context of blockchain, DAGs enable faster transactions and greater scalability, while PDAGs extend these benefits with a focus on privacy.\nBy calculating unlinkability and untraceability metrics within a PDAG framework, it becomes possible to quantitatively assess the privacy level of a blockchain network.\nThis analytical approach allows for comparisons with other privacy-centric solutions, such as CoinJoin, Tornado Cash, and privacy-focused blockchains like Monero and Zcash.\nThrough PDAGs, developers can identify potential weaknesses in privacy measures and enhance the network’s resistance to analysis and tracking, ensuring a secure and private environment for users.\nBy incorporating decoy inputs in shielded and deshielded transactions, we further obscure the link between public and private states, significantly reducing the risk of privacy breaches.\nIn essence, the Nescience project’s state separation method not only advances privacy and scalability in blockchain technology\nbut also sets new standards in protecting user data through a sophisticated blend of theoretical models and practical implementations.\nThis approach not only addresses current privacy concerns but also lays the groundwork for future investigations into efficient and secure private state exchanges.\nTo provide a structured approach to the development of the advanced State Separation Architecture for the Nescience project,\nfocusing on privacy enhancement, we can break down the milestone into distinct sub-milestones, each with its own specific work breakdown and deliverables.\n\nJustification §\nWork Breakdown and Deliverables §\n\n\n\n Sub Milestone 1 (Q2 2024): Execution Types and Privacy Mechanism Design\n\nWork Breakdown: Define and design the distinct execution types (public, private, shielded, and deshielded) and their respective privacy mechanisms, integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for enhanced privacy.\n\n\n\n Deliverables: Set of comprehensive deliverables, including an Execution Type Design Document that offers an in-depth analysis of the specifications and workflows for public, private, shielded, and deshielded executions in the Nescience state separation architecture -&gt; Execution Types Document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sub Milestone 2 (Q2 2024): Cryptographic Infrastructure and Nullification Strategy\n\nWork Breakdown: Develop the cryptographic infrastructure necessary for the state separation architecture, including nullifiers and accumulators, to prevent double-spending and ensure unlinkability of notes.

Sub milestones may slightly change and some of them might be accomplished faster than others especially that during the previous period, we have focused on existing zkVMs and extensively studied the integration of cryptographic primitives to enhance pivacy."},"archive/2024h1/vac/nim/core-libs/vac/chronos-maintainance":{"title":"chronos-maintainance","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"archive/2024h1/vac/nim/index":{"title":"Nim Unit","links":["vac/nim/tooling/vac/nim-suggest","vac/nim/tooling/vac/nimble","vac/nim/tooling/vac/compiler","vac/nim/tooling/vac/editor","vac/nim/tooling/vac/lsp","vac/nim/core-libs/vac/chronos-maintainance"],"tags":["nim","vac"],"content":"vac:nim: §\n\ntooling:vac: §\n\n nim-suggest\n nimble\n compiler\n editor\n lsp\n\ncore-libs:vac: §\n\n chronos-maintainance\n"},"archive/2024h1/vac/nim/tooling/vac/compiler":{"title":"compiler","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"archive/2024h1/vac/nim/tooling/vac/editor":{"title":"editor","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"archive/2024h1/vac/nim/tooling/vac/lsp":{"title":"lsp","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"archive/2024h1/vac/nim/tooling/vac/nim-suggest":{"title":"nim-suggest","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"archive/2024h1/vac/nim/tooling/vac/nimble":{"title":"nimble","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"archive/2024h1/vac/p2p/index":{"title":"P2P Service Unit","links":["vac/p2p/nimlibp2p/vac/gossipsub-improvements-eip-4844","vac/p2p/nimlibp2p/vac/webrtc-transport","vac/p2p/nimlibp2p/vac/gossipsub-ddos-mitigation","vac/p2p/nimlibp2p/vac/gossipsub-stagger-send","vac/p2p/nimlibp2p/vac/maintenance","vac/p2p/nimchronos/vac/maintenance"],"tags":["p2p","vac"],"content":"vac:p2p: §\n\nnimlibp2p:vac: §\nThe P2P Service unit develops nim-libp2p.\nnim-libp2p  roadmap on github: https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/issues/777\n\n gossipsub-improvements-eip-4844\nwebrtc-transport\ngossipsub-ddos-mitigation\ngossipsub-stagger-send\nmaintenance\n\nnimchronos:vac: §\n\nmaintenance\n"},"archive/2024h1/vac/p2p/nimchronos/vac/maintenance":{"title":"Libchronos Maintenance","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"vac:p2p:nimchronos:vac:maintenance §\n\n\nstatus: ongoing\nCC: p2p team\n\nDescription §\n\nrepo: https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos\n"},"archive/2024h1/vac/p2p/nimlibp2p/vac/gossipsub-ddos-mitigation":{"title":"Gossipsub DDoS Mitigation","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"vac:p2p:nimlibp2p:vac:gossipsub-ddos-mitigation §\n\n%%{ \n  init: { \n    &#039;theme&#039;: &#039;base&#039;, \n    &#039;themeVariables&#039;: { \n      &#039;primaryColor&#039;: &#039;#BB2528&#039;, \n      &#039;primaryTextColor&#039;: &#039;#fff&#039;, \n      &#039;primaryBorderColor&#039;: &#039;#7C0000&#039;, \n      &#039;lineColor&#039;: &#039;#F8B229&#039;, \n      &#039;secondaryColor&#039;: &#039;#006100&#039;, \n      &#039;tertiaryColor&#039;: &#039;#fff&#039;

VacLab is a resource provided to Vac by Riff Labs Limited,\nintended to help us perform detailed simulations\nand deployments of distributed systems at scale\nas well as the systems and dependencies that surround them.\nWith the VacLab reaching maturity where it can start being used comfortably\nto advance IFT’s research, development testing efforts, and quality control,\nwe want to ensure it is being used to its full potential\nand that teams understand that the resource exists,\nand if they find a useful case for their work being improved\nby collaboration with the DST team through VacLab,\nthey should be comfortable reaching out to us,\nand confident that we will be willing to try and help them,\nbased on our attitude and more importantly the track record\nand results we will produce using these tools and our expertise.\nThe lab will be treated as an IaaS-style service at first,\nwith the raw underlying infrastructure being developed in partnership with Riff Labs\nwho handles the details of making that IaaS layer available to us and reliable.\nAs we progress through the maturity of the lab,\nwe will transition to supporting a more PaaS or even SaaS software model,\nwhere as much as possible is accessible to the IFT ecosystem and teams\nto use and benefit from without them needing to concern themselves with the details of the underlying infrastructure or be blocked by the need to build and manage their own.\nWe will move towards self service testing and deployment,\nand by doing so unblock and accelerate the development, R&amp;D and productionisation\nof IFT’s projects by providing a safe and reliable place to experiment and test.\nIt will continue to provide significant efficiency benefits in terms of cost vs output when compared to cloud providers\nand even on traditional premises deployment of infrastructure,\nusing many independent and cheaper nodes\nrather than larger more powerful vertically scaled machines,\nbuilding on second hand and used equipment,\nand “patching around” the unreliability of individual hardware,\nby ensuring everything is resilient and reliable even in the face of individual failures,\nand in doing so continue to reduce and control the costs of testing our systems at scale.\nThrough the use of the VacLab\nwe will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:\n\n\nproviding a unique capability to the IFT ecosystem\nthat would not otherwise be available to them,\nlower the barrier to entry for teams needing research -\nor services that require infrastructure -\nby lowering the cost and removing the need for them to get it themselves\nthrough cloud providers that provide less flexibility and direct control,\n\n\nusing our knowledge of what is possible to do with these resources,\nbased on who is already using them,\nand apply that knowledge to intuit new use cases\nthat will unlock better collaboration between teams and the DST,\ndriving and accelerating development of IFT projects\nsuch as Waku, Codex, Nomos and more.\n\n\nAccelerating initiatives by providing the means, capability and encouragement\nto test every aspect of anything that can be tested in a simulation,\nacross every team and use case that is interested in doing so,\nup to the limits of what the DST team can support.\n\n\nWe will also provide support for the Premier Research destination narrative by:\n\nAllowing public access to non-sensitive telemetry and metrics from non-sensitive systems such as Codex storage nodes, and potentially even

Scalability Research.\nThe first step is to integrate the influence of these control\nmessages into the model provided in the reference,\nsimplifying where necessary. Any simplifications should be clearly\nexplained and justified to ensure a proper understanding of the trade-offs involved.\nThe focus then shifts to determining the overhead imposed by IDontWant control\nmessages on the network and subtracting these costs from the total bandwidth\nusage to quantify their net benefits in terms of traffic reduction.\nIn this phase, we can assume that all messages are small and later analyzing\nscenarios assuming all messages are large. Latency effects also need to be addressed,\nparticularly the case where multiple control messages arrive at varying times.\nTo start, the model should simulate situations where three messages are received at once,\nwhile two additional messages arrive later and are discarded by gossipsub\ndue to their lateness. A refined approach must consider how to reduce these\nlosses, potentially by introducing a probability distribution to predict\nlate arrivals and better handle them in the network.\nDeliverables

the strategic objective of scaling project capacity and legitimacy via community co-creation is captured in the annual goal of increasing user-generated content,\ncode and participation by 50% over the course of 2025.\nThe preceding step is to set up all projects to accept open-source contributions via an RFC culture.\nSecond, we have the distinct advantage that we are an actor in our own ecosystem, resulting in the unfair advantage of being our own first community.\nCollaboration within our family of projects not only yield efficiencies, but also doubles as a competitive advantage.\nVAC contributes to both these goals as an internal conduit of expertise, as well as an RFC culture carrier.\nViable strategies for a conduit of expertise and culture carrier seem to include: VAC to maintain a repository on internal knowledge creation (via ie the IFT research calls),\nRFC culture (to lay the foundation for external contributions), and to identify and facilitate IFT project synergies (collaboration between projects must be seen as a way to become more efficient).\n2 Premier Research destination [externally] §\nIFT builds public goods to safeguard civil liberties in the digital age. Ownerless public goods are maintained by movements,\ntherefore community building is a strategic priority, where VAC plays a technical role.\nIf only IFT maintains IFT incubated projects a year from now, that would be a failure; if a diverse community maintains projects, that would be a success.\nUltimately, VAC has the potential to become the equivalent to Ethereum Research.\nFirst, via VAC, IFT already has substantial ties to the Libp2p, Ethereum, and Nim ecosystems. Second, the IFT ecosystem of projects is the first community of contributors.\nViable strategies for a community platform seem to include: To link VAC contributions within other communities back to VAC,\nto externalise IFT research call digests, to build trust in projects by open sourcing internal audits/QA/roadmap discussions.\nWhat to watch out for: A process without a use (ie improvement processes); build value first, community second, and processes last.\nTask Tag Structure §\nThe following descibes a fully qualified task tag\nvac:&lt;unit&gt;:&lt;for_project&gt;:&lt;quarter-cname&gt;:&lt;tname&gt;\n\nvac indicates it is a vac commitment\nunit indicates the vac unit p2p, dst, qa ,tke, acz, sc, nes, rfc\nfor_project indicates which Logos project the commitment is mainly for nomos, waku, codex, nimbus, status;

This was done by (1) implementing methods on the sequencer side (by checking the transaction before entering the mempool and sending an error back: With this approach we can easily add additional error causes, for example chain state validation); and (2) by refactoring the sequencer to return errors immediately (chain state validation before pushing transaction into mempool).\nOptimised the privacy flag verification process to enable single-transaction validations for private smart contracts: this reduces delays caused by multi-epoch operations and streamlines state updates. Here the focus was on (1) analysing the current mechanism, (2) analysing the roll-up based approach sync mechanism and its drawbacks, (3) analysing and proposing alternative approaches as fragmentation and short-time for privacy flags, and (4) providing fairness and privacy balance of the proposed method.\n\n\nList of deliverables (ordered as in task management):\n\nCurrent UTXOs workflow.\nCircuit modification for UTXOs.\nProgrammable smart contracts with Risczero.\nSmart contract deployment.\nError handling on zkVM methods.\nMethods on the sequencer side implementation.\nChain state validation implementation.\nCurrent mechanism analysis.\nRoll-up mechanism analysis.\nFragmentation and STE.\nFairness and privacy balance.\n\n\nCompleted tasks (big tasks):\n\nvac:nes:2025q1:state-separation-architecture-poc:sc-prog\nvac:nes:2025q1:state-separation-architecture-poc:sc-chain\nvac:nes:2025q1:state-separation-architecture-poc:sc-flags\n\n\n\n\n"},"monthly/2025-02":{"title":"2025-02 Vac monthly","links":[],"tags":["vac-monthly"],"content":"Vac Monthly Report 2025/02 §\nP2P §\nhighlights §\n\nFinalized staggered message sending article\nMajor progress on async exception tracking with most of the modules having been annotated with the exceptions they raise\nProper stream closing and allowing the setup of custom certificate validators in nim-quic\nFix certificate generation, and add parameter to choose encoding in PEM/DER\n\nreport §\n\nift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements\n\nFinalized staggered message sending article\nCompleted golibp2p-gossipsub simulation for shadow\nCreated rust-libp2p gossipsub simulation for shadow.

This leads to an open question on how NSSA enables users to invoke public smart contracts with a private transaction.\nWe also got some improvements regarding the gas model and limits on usage.\n\nReport §\n\nvac:nes:state-separation-architecture-poc\n\nOverview:\n\nAnalysed the impact of epoch-based execution on SE and DE workflows, identifying key bottlenecks and researching approaches to minimise delays.\nInvestigated how zk-rollups and zkVMs are affected by epoch constraints and explored methods to submit ‘intermediate’ transactions alongside initial transactions to improve efficiency.\nExplored Miden’s approach to addressing NSSA execution constraints and considered circuit modifications for more efficient processing.\nExamined multi-epoch constraints in SE &amp; DE to assess feasibility for single-epoch execution without compromising correctness or performance.\nRevisited time-release approaches and investigated using zkEVM instead of zkVM R0 for improved efficiency.\nAddressed sandbox testnet feedback by refactoring code to enhance maintainability, scalability, and performance. Fixes included improving warning handling, error handling, redundancy reduction, and updating JSON RPC documentation for node RPC.\nDeveloped a gas model for RISC0 zkVM by profiling opcode usage, memory costs, and computational overhead. This research will support a decentralised sequencer model with predictable and efficient gas consumption.\n\n\nList of deliverables (ordered as in task management):\n\nWarning handling\nError handling\nRedundancy fix\nREADME JSON RPC DOCS for node RPC\nEpoch constraints in NSSA\nZkvms Vs.

synchronization mechanism and investigated alternative syncing workflow.\nProposed several appraoches and identified the best fit for NSSA providing benefits and drawbacks to address in Q2.\nExplored alternative data structures, such as Verkle trees, CMTs amd IMTs, to improve nullifier scalability.\nDeveloped a Rust library that provides a seamless interface for developers.\nImplemented an approach to handle UTXO scalability issue.\n\nReport §\nEnable smart contract capabilities for the zkVM\n\nvac:nes:state-separation-architecture-poc\n\n\nOverview:\n\nRedesigned the synchronization mechanism to reduce dependency on zkVM. Several approaches were explored and analyzed in depth. From Homomrphic encryption approached to more practical approaches as the refined multi epoch sync, the single-epoch atomic sync, the hybrid rollup sync, to finish with DP.\nExplored ways for data structures for NSSA to improve the nullifier scalibility. We identified the limitation of SMTs and made a survey on CMTs and VTs. Research conducted gave us a direction towards IMTs which improve search scalability by replacing linked-list with a different sorted structure that has more efficient search algorithms. However, additional research is needed to overcome some drawbacks in the IMTs design.\nDeveloped a Rust library that enables smart contract capabilities for R0 in NSSA and seamless interface for developers. We have added a number of different helperfunctions for that.\nImplemented an approach to handle UTXO scalability issue. We added 1 byte tag to an encoded UTXO additional field where the users create tags at a start of parsing transaction, and if their tags align with UTXO tag, they try to decode UTXO.\n\n\n\nList of

version of the SNT staking protocol for testnet deployment.\nDescription §\nIn collaboration with Status, we are building a staking protocol that enables holders of SNT to stake their tokens to ultimately earn non-transferable “XP” tokens,\nwhich can later be used to participate in community-driven governance, such as voting apps, and to get access to premium features in the Status app.\nWe’re aiming to have a first version of the staking protocol ready for deployment on an EVM based test network of Status’ choice by the end of Q4 2024.\nThis will give us the opportunity to test the system in a distributed environment.\nFuture commitments will allow us to refine the system and add additional features as required by Status.\nHere are the main features and requirements of the first version of the staking protocol:\n\nUsers can stake SNT tokens and accumulate “multiplier points” in return (multiplier points are later used to determine the amount of XP tokens a user has access to)\nMultiplier points are generated at an at least 1:1 ratio with the amount of SNT staked, at the time of staking\nUsers can lock their SNT tokens for a certain period of time (e.g. 3 months - 4 years) to earn additional multiplier points, at the time of staking\nUsers can unstake their SNT tokens at any time (unless locked)\nMultiplier points accrue as a function of time and the amount of SNT staked\nStaking protocol should be upgradable\nUsers should be able to opt out of upgrades\n\nWe’ve already implemented two different staking algorithms,\nso we can leverage this work to

for real-time balance updates in the protocol.\nHowever, the former comes with a few architectural benefits that we’d like to leverage as well.\nNamely the composition of StakeVault and StakeManager

don’t run into scenarios where users will lock their stake for an amount of time that is not beneficial to the amount of XP they’ll earn.\nIn this iteration,\nwe want to revisit this functionality and ideally allow for users to lock their funds multiple times.\nExample:\n\nUser stakes funds\nUser locks funds for 3 months\n3 months pass\nUser locks funds again\nRepeat (as long as it makes

While doing so I created a PR (here) and some Issues (#66, #69 #70, #71) with questions and comments about implementations that seemed to deviate from the current specifications.\n\n\n"},"updates/2025-05-19":{"title":"2025-05-19 Vac weekly","links":[],"tags":["vac-updates"],"content":"Vac 2025/5/19 §\nhighlights §\n\nnim-libp2p 1.10.0 released (QUIC transport support)\nDST report for nim-libp2p 1.10.0 (QUIC)\nMultiple DST analyses and measurements on libp2p mix protocol\nStatus communities contracts now deployed on Polgon POS Mainnet and Amoy\nKarma slashing capabilities done\nnew commitment for Status Network Staking RFC\n\nvac:p2p: §\n\nift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements\n\nWork on performance comparison for current gossipsub proposals\n\nCreated PoC implementation for push-pull phase transition\nCreated PoC implementation for GossipSub v2.0 (Will finalize today)\n\n\n\n\nvac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-kad-dht:routing-and-rpc\n\nWriting unit-tests in nim-libp2p#1324.\nIroning out impl of routing tables, and finding nodes based on test units\n\n\nvac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-maintenance:maintenance\n\nnim-quic#71 fix: close should clean stream userdata\ninvestigated failing hole punching interop tests\n\nchore(interop): use the same redis dependency nim-libp2p#1364\nchore(hp): add timeout on dial nim-libp2p#1378\n\n\ninvestigated failing transport interop tests\n\nci(interop): disable transport interop with zig-v0.0.1 nim-libp2p#1372\n\n\ninvestigated unit test hanging on macos\n\nnim-libp2p#1376\n\n\nspeculation: all three of above suggest issues with quic transport (or some connection issues)\nForked nim-jwt into vacp2p to apply a patch I needed since the latest commit is from 2 years ago and the maintainer hasn’t responded to my PR in a couple weeks\n\nBumped nim-stew version to 0.4.0 in order to properly get new features from it (especially base36) per @arnetheduck’s recommendation\nREADME.md “improvements”\n\n\n\n\nvac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-webtransport:http3-client\n\nsmaller progress made\nrealized that http3 will not be easly integrated on top of quic because http3 requires different callbacks, which requires structires…\n\n\nCreated draft PR for AutoTLS\n\nvac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-autotls:certificate-request-auth\n\nOK with tests\n\n\nvac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-autotls:dns-challenge\n\nOK with tests\n\n\nvac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-autotls:certificate-installation\n\nIn progress, tests already in place\n\n\nOn Thursday I figured why testall was failing when adding testatutotls.nim to testnative (TLDR: GC shennanigans)\n\n\nmisc/admin\n\nWork 1d with Sasha from js-waku team to figure out why yamux was sending a goaway\n\nmultistream select spec is not clear in what to do when a protocol is not supported\njs-waku was attempting to use store protocol and nwaku did not have it enabled\njs-libp2p sends a goaway when a protocol is not supported.\nOther implementations do different: nim-libp2p sends a fin, go-waku sends a rst\n\n\n2 cc 1d OoO\n\n\n\nvac:tke: §\n\nvac:tke:ift:ghost:tokenomics-design\n\nmet with Matt to discuss this, and read documentation\n\n\nvac:tke:ift:support-to-ift-units::logos-basket\n\nreviewed old discussion about Logos as a basket of tokens\nproduce a doc on baskets and independent ones\nreviewed Martin’s token proposal\nmet with TKE to brainstorm about logos token\n\n\nvac:tke:ift:support-to-ift-units::tge\n\ndiscussed with TKE a check list for the TGE workgroup\n\n\nvac:tke:nomos:macroeconomy::preliminary-block-rewards\n\nread two posts about ETH issuance rate\nextensive discussion about it with Nomos team\nincorporated feedback into requirements doc\n\n\nvac:tke:nomos:macroeconomy:block-rewards\n\nWorked on tasks related to nomos DA, TFMs and block rewards\nCreated introductory documents explaining the pros and cons of several mechanisms for Nomos\n\n\nvac:tke:codex:cdx-launch::preparations\n\nmet with Codex team to discuss CDX launch\n\n\nvac:tke:status:karma-incentives:karma-params\n\nrevisit the Karma spreadsheet\nsync with Nadeem and SC team on RLN and Karma onboarding\n\n\nvac:tke:status:karma-incentives:karma-params\n\nFinalized data analysis work on Linea to define/propose the rewards tiers\nWrote down report on the above\n\n\nvac:tke:ift:tokenomics-research-forum:tke-dashboard\n\nfind a research topic\n\n\nvac:tke:ift:tokenomics-research-forum::minting-control\n\nresearched work on optimal control and minting\n\n\n\nvac:qa: §\n\n\nnomos:2025q2-da-testing:data-confidentiality\n\ntest: Da networking encryption -

The list of these milestones should serve as a guidepost to anyone who is interested in what the project is working on, what the deliverables are of that work, and how that work is going.\n\n\n                  \n                  If you don&#039;t like &quot;Milestone&quot;, call it whatever you want as long as it&#039;s in line with this description. \n                  \n                \n\nThis document is an outline of how you should think about creating milestones for your project, and what information should be included in them such that the IFT Grant Process can be completed and everyone stays on the same page.\nProjects work to produce things for people, and a milestone describes, plans, and tracks those things. To that end, the deliverables are the key components to reason around what a milestone is for your project. Who are you building for, what are you building for them, and why do they care? A small group of deliverables and the justified impact they have towards their targeted audience should be enough to help someone understand what a project is doing.\nIn effect, a given milestone is a declaration of:\n\nHere’s what we want to happen\nThis is why this needs to happen\nHere’s how we’re going to make that happen\nThis is what we need to do it\nHere’s how you can watch\nThis is how confident we are that we can get it done (in time)\n\nThe scope of a given milestone is such that the total amount of work you plan for the year equates to ~4-5 individual milestones. For a small project, that’s focused and tight. For a large project, that’s cross-functional and broad. It is expected that larger projects have the appropriate project management resources to sub-divide their milestones in to sub-milestones, epics, and issues as appropriate.\nWe ask that the structure of the milestone is somewhat standardized across the IFT, as we have a lot of derivative and automation tasks to perform.\nHere’s a list of the sections that need to be included in each milestone:\n\nMilestone Title §\nA short name of the milestone that succinctly describes its aim and scope.\nEstimated Delivery Date §\nA timeline in which the work is expected to be delivered\nDescription §\nMore detail as to what you’re aiming to accomplish with this milestone and the justification for its inclusion to the project. This is the human readable encapsulation of the milestone. Someone reading it should be able to understand the general scope of the entire thing, with all other sections adding context and detail.\nResources Required §\n\nroles and % application to it\nexternal services consumed (Vac/IFT)\ninfrastructure\n\nThis information here, in combination with the IFT Finance team, should be enough to yield the required budget for the milestone. This allows for private financial information to stay appropriately separated while still allowing us to publish and broadcast the roadmaps (and their progress) to the broader communities.\nDeliverables §\nWhat are the tangible items that are the result of this milestone’s work, and who is the targeted audience for those items?\nIt is important to note that we’ve included the intended audience here. Is this a research PoC to be delivered to the Engineering team? Is this a mainnet launch that we need wide community broadcasting on? Is this an SDK being delivered to another IFT project? The appropriate communication of the deliverable should be considered here.\nTracking Metrics §\nHow we track progress on a given milestone is dependent upon what the goal of the milestone is and deliverables it aims to accomplish. As per Jarrad’s Strategy Document and mantra from previous talks, metrics around User Acquisition and Revenue Generation should be included wherever possibly appropriate. If it isn’t directly aimed at these two, its impact on how it facilitates it should be understood.\nNOTE: The IFT Insights team will closely monitor all of these and provide dashboards to relevant stakeholders such that progress and status can be monitored and acted upon.\nWork Breakdown §\nSince this is the highest level of “work package” that is considered throughout the org, a description of the way this is going to be broken up and managed should be itemized here. This section is a process of showing “this is explicitly how we plan to deliver this milestone.”\nNOTE: It is recommended that the broken down work is structured similarly so it can be understood and tracked, e.g. Milestone -&gt; Epics -&gt; Issues by the IFT Insights team, with each layer more narrowed in scope and explicit in detail. Each project has a significant level of autonomy on how they deliver on the agreed upon milestones and the associated project management and organization that entails it.\nPerceived Risks §\nEach milestone should include a section of what dependencies/assumptions/potential market changes there are that add risk to its completion. What factors come into play that can potentially affect the project delivery date, and how do each of them affect its delivery?"}}
