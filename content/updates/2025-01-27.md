    - Facing some issues in peer connections, looking into it

      Turns out it's due to an oversight in how bindings for waku were implemented. (This affects both `go-waku` and `nwaku` bindings)
      Discussed the problem with Waku Team, and this [issue](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/issues/3246) was created product of that discussion.
      In the meantime, a workaround was suggested to use a single pubsub subscription instead.
