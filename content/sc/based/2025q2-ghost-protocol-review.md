Review the ghost.fun protocol and provide feedback to the team.

## Description

The ghost.fun team is working on a protocol that uses smart contracts to create a decentralized marketplace for memecoins.
Users can create memecoins and trade them on the ghost.fun platform.
Once a memecoin reaches a certain market cap, trading is disabled.
At this point, a Uniswap V3 pool can be created by any users for that memecoin (and ETH).
The ghost.fun team asked us to review their protocol and provide feedback on the smart contracts they are using.
