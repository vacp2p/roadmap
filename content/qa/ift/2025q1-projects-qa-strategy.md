## Description
Document existing QA strategy for IFT projects.

Create a knowledge base containing the QA strategy for all projects under the IFT umbrella.
For each project, we will document the existing tests, coverage, how and when they are run,
any identified gaps, and recommendations for improvement.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
* By documenting and evaluating the QA strategy of each IFT project,
  VAC QA strengthens the overall efficiency and collaboration within the IFT ecosystem.
* This initiative will ensure that projects are aligned with best practices,
  identify areas for improvement, and foster knowledge sharing across teams.
* It contributes to maintaining a high standard for both internal and external contributions
  by helping keep projects well-tested and reliable.

**Alignment with FURPS:**  

* **Functionality**:
  * By documenting the existing QA strategy and evaluating test coverage for IFT projects,
    this effort ensures that all projects are thoroughly tested and aligned with functional requirements.  
* **Supportability**:
  * A centralized knowledge base makes it easier for teams to maintain, adapt, and improve QA practices across projects,
    fostering collaboration and efficiency.  
* **Reliability**:
  * Identifying gaps and providing recommendations
    improves the robustness and predictability of each project's testing processes,
    reducing the risk of undetected issues.
