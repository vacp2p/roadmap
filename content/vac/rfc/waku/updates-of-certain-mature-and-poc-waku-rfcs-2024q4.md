`ift:rfc:waku:updates-of-certain-mature-and-poc-waku-rfcs-2024q4`

Help audit raw and draft selected Waku RFCs that are mature and decide which proof of concept RFCs can go to rfc-index.
## Description

In this commitment we are helping support and drive the audit of the following mature RFCs (that are either in draft or raw state):
- 10/WAKU2 
- 12/WAKU2-FILTER 
- 13/WAKU2-STORE 
- 14/WAKU2-MESSAGE 
- 17/WAKU2-RLN-RELAY
- 19/WAKU2-LIGHTPUSH 
- 34/WAKU2-PEER-EXCHANGE
- 15/WAKU-BRIDGE

As part of this commitment we will also go through the proof of concept RFCs that are within the Waku [documentation](https://github.com/waku-org/specs) and potentially move them to rfc-index. 

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

* The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository for RFCs regarding all the IFT projects.
* By providing information and benefits of the RFC Culture, we want to have projects apply their RFCs to the team of rfc-editors, in the future.
* One of our ideals is to have the broader web3 community utilize our RFCs to potentially implement within their projects and ecosystems (similar to how [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) works).
