`vac:rfc:ift:2025q3-logos-poc`

## Description

This commitment revolves around a continuous effort
providing feedback and iterating upon
selected Logos POC specifications.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository
for RFCs regarding all IFT projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture,
we hope to incentivize projects to submit their RFCs
to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs
in their projects, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
