## Description
Test Codex on each new version or requested feature
and look for regressions if this is required.
Help Codex with testing and benchmarking new features.

### Background

We want to learn specific, actionable information
about Codex's behaviour
and how it is evolving over time
with each new release
and with each thing we are specifically asked to check and test.

We will use a combination of real world testing,
theoretical analysis and experiments.
