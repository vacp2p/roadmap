#### Description
Get the core mix functionality in nim-libp2p as Prototype / Unstable state, this will allow mix to be used in PoCs or experiments. Some rough edges and minor issues expected, not recommended for production and API and internal structure subject to changes. Implement any needed refactorings, code cleanup and style conformity, as well as setting up the repository so CI tasks for running test units and ensuring code formatting is applied, and master branch protection is enabled.

#### Deliverables
