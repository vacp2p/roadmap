## Vac 2025/03/31

### vac:p2p:
- `ift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements`
    - Created talk on GossipSub v1.4 proposal for virtual libp2p day
    - Created [PR for nim, go, rust test nodes](https://github.com/vacp2p/dst-gossipsub-test-node/pull/6)
        - Fixed some isses with gossipsubv2.0 simulation, but it still runs for v. small number of messages / network size
    - Worked on running nimbus in EthShadow (Still a WiP)
- `ift:2025q1-nimlibp2p-wrapping-ngtcp2:tls_handshake`
    - [nim-quic#c3bf40](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-quic/commit/c3bf40344bb03f692ba7b36e60625678a0de3c8f) fix: ALPN buffer FFI
    - [nim-libp2p#1298](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1298) refactor: use openssl instead of mbedTLS
        - mbedtls fails to compile in arm64 (there's an open issue in their repo)
        - we are already using openssl so mbedtls is not really needed for now
        - If ngtcp2 releases a version that can use mbedtls succesfully, and mbedtls fixes their compilation issues, we can consider removing openssl then and use mbedtls.
    - [nim-quic#64](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-quic/pull/64) fix: handle handshake failures on client side
    - [nim-quic#65](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-quic/pull/65) feat: wait for handshake on incoming connection and get access to certificate chain
    - [nim-libp2p#1301](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1301) feat: `withQuicTransport`
    - [nim-libp2p#1302](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1302) fix: set peerId on incoming Quic connection
    - Finally, merged the nim-quic and nim-libp2p feature PR. This task is 100% complete
- `ift:2025q1-nimlibp2p-wrapping-ngtcp2:certificate_validation`
    - rebasing and merging open PRs
    - feat(certificate): add date verification [#1299](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1299)
        - adds parameters for certificate valid from/to times
    - chore(quic): add tests with invalid certs [#1297](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1297)
        - finished implementing test cases, improved test logic
