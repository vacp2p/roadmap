`vac:rfc:waku:2025q2-rfc-iteration`

Iteration commitments generally comprise:
through discussion and curation,
support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected Waku RFCs.

## Description

This commitment supports the audit of mature RFCs, which are 
either in draft or raw states. The audit comprises of:
- Reading through the spec;
- Checking the relevant codebase;
- Changing the parts of the spec (descriptions and codebase) where applicable;
- Updates of relevant links;
- Changing the RFC status (optional);
- Going through rounds of feedback with the relevant project team;
- Adding clarifications where needed in the spec;
- Checking for inconsistencies with other documentation/codebase.

The following RFCs will be worked on in this quarter:
- 

We will also include specification validation - 
editorial work through previous and future RFCs to improve them
(identify edge cases for example)

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository
for RFCs regarding all IFT 
  projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture,
we hope to incentivize projects to submit their RFCs
to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs
in their projects, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
- We aim to provide feedback on specifications
from the point of view of a new developer.
