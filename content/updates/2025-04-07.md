    - finished
- `misc/admin`
    - Review autonat and hole punching code:
        - autonat: 
            - we have implemented 1.0.0 version of specs; available via `withAutonat` on `SwitchBuilder`
            - missing the most recent is 2.0.0 version - `go-libp2p` has that implemented
        - hole punching: 
            - there is service that implements this logic and there is test for service; 
            - no support via `SwitchBuilder` to enable hole punching. it can be added manually to `SwitchBuilder` using `withServices` method.
