## Description

This commitment involves developing Contribute Portal, a comprehensive contribution hub that recognizes open source contributors and helps new developers make their first meaningful contributions to the Logos ecosystem. The portal serves as a critical component of the volunteer-driven, open source community building strategy, showcasing contributor activity, providing curated resources, and offering clear pathways for community engagement.

The Contribute Portal directly supports the quarterly KPIs by:
- **External Developer Contributions**: Tracking and encouraging 10% month-over-month increase in external developers contributing to the Logos technology stack
- **Community Activation**: Supporting the 10% activation benchmark for new community members through clear contribution pathways
- **Hacktivation Barriers**: Providing 10% increase in tagged lower tasks by CCs in GitHub repositories
- **Community Retention**: Helping retain contributors through recognition and engagement systems

**Key Features Include:**
- **Contributor Directory**: Displays GitHub usernames, profile links, contribution counts, and contribution history
- **Individual Profiles**: Detailed pages with contribution details and complete contribution lists
- **Search Functionality**: Search by GitHub username or repository name
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear instructions and best practices maintained on GitHub
- **Contributor Ladder**: Structured growth path where contributors earn recognition, responsibilities, and privileges (from leaderboard presence and swag to reviewer rights and governance roles) as they progress through ranks
- **Contributors Leaderboard**: Seasonal and all-time rankings highlight active contributors across coding, design, documentation, translation, etc.
- **Proposal Submission**: Form allowing developers, writers, designers, and others to submit proposals
- **GitHub Issues Integration**: Display curated issues from contribute.logos.co repository
