    - [nim-libp2p#1389](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1389) chore: make quic optional
        - Nimbus does not want runtime dependencies when quic is not being used
        - Added a compile time flag that will determine whether Quic is going to be compiled or not
        - Ended up creating v1.10.1 so nimbus would not be stopped from updating nim-libp2p version
    - [nim-libp2p#1392](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1392) chore: move `-d:libp2p_quic_support` flag to `.nimble`

    - investigate why ci was failing (interop tests and unit tests)
        - identified two issues
            - quic: framesorted did not reset all values
            - quic: timeouts was not behaving correctly
                - proposed fix [nim-quic#72](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-quic/pull/72), that was later on improved by richard
        - added some improvements to nim-libp2p
            - ci(test): reduce timeout [nim-libp2p#1376](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1376)

        -  feat(framesorter): add fastpath for emitting data [nim-quic#78](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-quic/pull/78)
        -  ci: reduce test timeout [nim-quic#77](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-quic/pull/77)
- `misc/admin`:
    - Forked https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-jwt and https://github.com/vacp2p/bearssl_pkey_decoder
        - Repos seem to be abandoned
        - Perhaps this functionality should be directly in bearssl?

- `ift:2025q2-rln-status-l2:rpc-node-modification`
    - Meeting on `Gasless Linea Besu discussion` -> not plugin but a linea node modification
     - Implement a plugin for RPC nodes to forward transaction data directly to the Prover.
        - Implementaion is on this [repo](https://github.com/vacp2p/status-linea-besu)
        - Changed approach for implementing the RPC node using the Linea-Besu codebase instead of Besu plugin feature.

- `ift:2025q2-libp2p-mix-testnet:dockerize`
    - Investigated incorrect logging of msgId and origin timestamps in mix nodes.
    - Confirmed the message is already GossipSub-processed; recovering original metadata requires identifying the byte offset where the payload begins.
    - Reviewed [PR #20](https://github.com/vacp2p/mix/pull/20) and flagged issues with msgId and timestamp extraction at intermediate hops and identifying the byte offset.
- `ift:2025q2-libp2p-mix-testnet:update-rfc`
    - Continued refactoring the Mix Protocol RFC [PR #158](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/pull/158)
        - Finalized all sections through §7 (Mix Core Responsibilities).
- `ift:2025q2-libp2p-mix-testnet:surb-implementation`
    - Began design work on SURB-based reply mechanism.
    - Early concern: if fragmentation remains external to Mix Protocol, recipients may need multiple SURBs to reply. This blocks replies unless the sender pre-supplies sufficient SURBs.
    - [PR 20](https://github.com/vacp2p/mix/pull/20)
      - Began properly familiarising.
      - Upstreamed the node testing into the poc branch (this avoids having to push to github any upstream dependency changes)
      - resolved issue of mis-reported msg-id
      - confirmed resiliancy at large-value msg-ids
- `nes:2025q2-nescience-consulting:unifying-q1-docs`
    - Delivered [unified Q1 document](https://www.notion.so/nes-2025q2-nescience-consulting-unifying-q1-docs-1eb8f96fb65c80c78c53d78004827ebc).
    - Delivered [fundamentals of Nescience presentation notes](https://www.notion.so/NSSA-presentation-1f88f96fb65c803da57ff30ce74dcd35).

    - Began work on [SE/DE improvements and sync](https://www.notion.so/nes-2025q2-nescience-consulting-SE-DE-improvements-1fc8f96fb65c80d19c4ad9b101f228ca).
        - Determined non-membership proof is likely the only optimisation for DE; changing nullifier tree structure to support BST would result in more drawbacks.
        - Examined edge cases to refine SE. 
- `ift:2025q2-rln-status-l2:rln-spec`
    - Init a [doc](https://www.notion.so/RLN-Deployment-Specs-1f98f96fb65c806c8737d94851b4d14d) for RLN deployment spec. Prover side mostly done. 
- `nes:2025q2-nescience-consulting:unifying-q1-docs` 
    - Reviewed [the unified document](https://www.notion.so/nes-2025q2-nescience-consulting-unifying-q1-docs-1eb8f96fb65c80c78c53d78004827ebc) before delivering.
