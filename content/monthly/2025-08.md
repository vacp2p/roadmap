            - Investigated and defined NSSA v0.1 protocol specs including types, accounts, programs, transactions' structure, and state transitions.
            - Investigated and defined NSSA sequencer specs including the block assembly process, the block structure and types, and the criteria for a well-formed block. All with pseudocode.
            - Worked on and implemented different types of cipher stream needed for the protocol using R0, including Chacha20 and Shake256. 
            - Designed the Token Program for NSSA and native Token. This includes the token creation and supply, the transfer logic, and the account types.
            - Drafted a first version of the fee mechanism for NSSA.
            - Improved our key protocol by updating some data.
            
        - Engineering-wise, we implemented:
            - Node refactor.
            - Wallet extraction.
            - Structural improvements.
            - Protocol public state and private state.
            - 80% of the sequencer specs.
            - 80% of the key protocol.
            - R0 encryption demos.
