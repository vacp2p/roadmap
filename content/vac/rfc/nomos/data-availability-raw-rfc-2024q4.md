`ift:rfc:nomos:data-availability-raw-rfc-2024q4`

Initiating the process of documentation for the raw RFC process for Nomos Data 
Availability (DA).

## Description

This commitment supports delivering a raw RFC for Nomos Data Availability (DA) 
through discussions, support, and inquiries. 
The goal is to establish RFC culture within the Nomos ecosystem,
contributing to standardized specifications across the IFT ecosystem.

The RFC will focus on DA in Nomos as its initial implementation is ongoing. 
Depending on the progress and communications, the RFC might be split into new 
RFCs or different ones might be opened.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to be a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture, we aim to incentivize projects to apply their 
  RFCs to the team of rfc-editors.
- We aim for the broader web3 community to use our RFCs within their projects 
  and ecosystems, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
