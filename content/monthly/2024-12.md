### Nim
#### highlights
- Smarter Dependency Resolution The SAT solver now falls back to a previous package version if the latest one is unsatisfiable.
- Improved Nim Version Selection Favors the userâ€™s system Nim version if it meets the package requirements.
- Caching & Misc Improvements Caches tagged packages for faster lookups.Includes various fixes and performance improvements.
- Nimble Task integration (run tasks from the Extension)
- Nim check is now the default linting backend (you can revert to nimsuggest chk by setting "nim.useNimCheck": false). This should help to reduce nimsuggest issues as nimsuggest chk is one of the most extensive commands.

### Nescience
#### highlights
- Started the advanced phase of implementing the sandboxed testnet.
- Focused on node workflow and interaction with other components.
- Research wise, focused on solving different issues as nullifier, proof aggregation, and UTXO false flags; moreover we focused on fixing some components of the cryptography module such as constants and generators.
- Defined the metrics for the testnet and run scenarios to test the architecture.

#### report
- `vac:nes:state-separation-architecture-poc`
    - Overview:
        - Implemented the node core structures, the node account interaction, the node sequencer interaction, the node transaction workflow, and the node rpc.
        - Defined a set of metrics for testing and implemented 5 sub-scenarios to test the basic behaviour of the architecture, and 2 complex scenrios to check more sophisticated behaviour.
        - Tested and analyzed the results of the testnet and output a documentation to represent the initial findings and future fixes.
        - Defined constants for NSSA key protocol, updated the generation of generators for the cryptography module, and defined when to use Poseidon and secp256k1.
        - Digged into some issues faced during the previous tasks and worked on initial solutions for nullifier, proof aggregation, and UTXO false flags.
