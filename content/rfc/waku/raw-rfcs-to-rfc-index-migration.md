`ift:rfc:waku:raw-rfcs-to-rfc-index-migration`

Decide which raw RFCs can be moved to rfc-index.

## Description

This commitment focuses on determining which raw RFCs in the 
Waku [documentation](https://github.com/waku-org/specs) should be moved
to the rfc-index.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team aims to become a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture, we hope to encourage projects to submit their 
  RFCs to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs in their projects, 
  similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
