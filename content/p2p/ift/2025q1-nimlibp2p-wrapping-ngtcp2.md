`vac:p2p:ift:2025q1-nimlibp2p-wrapping-ngtcp2`

Wrap ngtcp2 in nim and integrate it as quic transport in nim-libp2p.

## Description

This commitment involves two main objectives:

*  Completing a deployable version of nim-quic by wrapping ngtcp2
*  Integrating this nim-quic implementation as a QUIC transport in nim-libp2p

We are dedicated to developing this wrapped version of the QUIC transport to a production-ready state,
ensuring it can be seamlessly integrated into various projects.
The development of a native Nim implementation of QUIC will be addressed in a future commitment.
