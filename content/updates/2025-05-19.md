## Vac 2025/5/19

### highlights
- nim-libp2p 1.10.0 released (QUIC transport support)
- DST report for nim-libp2p 1.10.0 (QUIC)
- Multiple DST analyses and measurements on libp2p mix protocol
- Status communities contracts now deployed on Polgon POS Mainnet and Amoy
- Karma slashing capabilities done
- new commitment for Status Network Staking RFC

### vac:p2p:
- `ift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements`
  - Work on performance comparison for current gossipsub proposals
	- Created PoC implementation for push-pull phase transition
	- Created PoC implementation for GossipSub v2.0 (Will finalize today)
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-kad-dht:routing-and-rpc`
    - Writing unit-tests in [nim-libp2p#1324](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1324).
    - Ironing out impl of routing tables, and finding nodes based on test units
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-maintenance:maintenance`
  - [nim-quic#71](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-quic/pull/71) fix: close should clean stream userdata 
  - investigated failing hole punching interop tests
      - chore(interop): use the same redis dependency [nim-libp2p#1364](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1364)
      - chore(hp): add timeout on dial [nim-libp2p#1378](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1378) 
  - investigated failing transport interop tests
      - ci(interop): disable transport interop with zig-v0.0.1 [nim-libp2p#1372](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1372)
  - investigated unit test hanging on macos
      - [nim-libp2p#1376](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1376)
  - speculation: all three of above suggest issues with quic transport (or some connection issues)
  - Forked [`nim-jwt` into vacp2p](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-jwt) to apply [a patch I needed](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-jwt/commit/0a59984730c87f703f3c5b2e833b8b6a1b45aedc) since the latest commit is from 2 years ago and the maintainer hasn't responded to [my PR](https://github.com/yglukhov/nim-jwt/pull/22) in a couple weeks
    - Bumped [nim-stew version to 0.4.0](https://github.com/status-im/nim-stew/pull/246) in order to properly get new features from it (especially base36) per [@arnetheduck's recommendation](https://discord.com/channels/613988663034118151/740631022080622745/1371484042800664671)
    - [`README.md` "improvements"](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1373)
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-webtransport:http3-client`
    - smaller progress made
    - realized that http3 will not be easly integrated on top of quic because http3 requires different callbacks, which requires structires...
- Created [draft PR for AutoTLS](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1358)
    - `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-autotls:certificate-request-auth`
        - OK with tests
    - `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-autotls:dns-challenge`
        - OK with tests
    - `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-autotls:certificate-installation`
        - In progress, tests already in place
    - On Thursday I figured why `testall` was failing when adding `testatutotls.nim` to `testnative` (TLDR: GC shennanigans) 
- `misc/admin`
    - Work 1d with Sasha from js-waku team to figure out why yamux was sending a goaway
        - multistream select spec is not clear in what to do when a protocol is not supported
        - js-waku was attempting to use store protocol and nwaku did not have it enabled
        - js-libp2p sends a goaway when a protocol is not supported.
        - Other implementations do different: nim-libp2p sends a fin, go-waku sends a rst
    - 2 cc 1d OoO
