Implementation of the next release of Zerokit 
## Description
This commitment entails exploring [Kademlia DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) 
and [DiscV5](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5.md) 
as discovery mechanisms for P2P networks, with a focus on identifying areas for improvement in 
latency, the anonymity-discoverability tradeoff, security, and scalability. 
Additionally, it includes assessing their suitability for IFT projects. 
The findings will be thoroughly documented and validated through reference implementations.

### Background

-

### Narratives

By utilizing discovery exploration commitment, 
we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Providing know-how about discovery mechanisms 
that will be tailored for many IFT teams such as Waku, Nomos, and Codex. 

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:
* Offers open source information such as blogposts and forum posts 
that show the improvement points of the discovery mechanism.
