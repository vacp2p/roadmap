Maintain and improve existing Status smart contracts as requested.

## Description

Smart contracts for Status that have already been implemented and deployed might still need maintenance.
This includes upgrading systems or fixing bugs that might be discovered after the contracts have been deployed.

The Smart Contracts team commits to providing maintenance service for existing smart contracts,
such as:

- Status ENS
- Status Communities Contracts
- Status Staking Protocol
- Status Voting DApp

## Task List

There are no concrete tasks associated to this commitment.
As requests come in,
they will be addressed by our team.
