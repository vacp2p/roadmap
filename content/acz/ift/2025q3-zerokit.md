Maintaining and improving Zerokit, including the release of its next version
## Description

This commitment entails developing and maintaining Zerokit, including Zerokit v0.9.0 release by advancing the next version.

### Background

[Zerokit](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit) is a collection of Zero Knowledge modules 
that focus on RLN, developed in Rust, intended for integration with various system programming environments.

During 2025q2, we release Zerokit v0.8.0 which is wasm integration and tree optimization with better performance. 

### Narratives

By utilizing the zerokit commitment, we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:

- Delivers an optimized version for IFT projects utilizing Zerokit, 
including [nwaku](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku)and [js-rln](https://github.com/waku-org/js-rln) and [Status L2](https://docs.status.network/).

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:

- Offers a Rust crate that serves as a more efficient open-source development tool for users 
looking to integrate RLN into their projects.
