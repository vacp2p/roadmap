## Description  
Extend existing integration tests for the Codex project to ensure that all API endpoints are thoroughly tested, <br/>
as the current tests only scratch the surface. 

Codex has a [rich API](https://api.codex.storage) that requires thorough testing to ensure robustness across all endpoints and functionalities.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**  
By expanding the integration tests for Codex, VAC QA contributes to maintaining high standards of API quality, <br/>
which directly supports the broader goal of ensuring spec adherence and improving the project's reliability.
