in order to ease the developer experience for coming developers.

The specifications in pipeline:
- Mantle
- Bedrock Genesis Block
- Bedrock Service Declaration Protocol
- Service Reward Distribution Protocol
- Anonymous Leaders Reward Protocol
- Wallet Technical Standard
- Block Construction, Validation and Execution
- Bedrock Architecture Overview
- Proof of Leadership
- Payload Formatting
- DA Encoding
- DA Rewarding
