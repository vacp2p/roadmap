## Roadmap Preview

### Q4 other potential commitments

- Nomos
  - Analyze scaling behavior
    - Network dynamis (message propagation, network topology, etc.)
    - Consensus scaling (throughput vs numbers of validators, etc) (probably done)
    - State/transaction layer bottlenecks (liveness/safety, etc) (probably done)
    - Adversarial robustness (prob done?)
    - Decentralization metrics (hardware requirements)

- VAC
  - Improve lab infrastructure.
    - Analyze current stack, find improvements
    - Automatize flow of delivering machines
    - Plug data from DST experiments in infra cortex
    - Optimize data scraping from DST experiments (datapoints from metrics, logs)

### 2026Q1
