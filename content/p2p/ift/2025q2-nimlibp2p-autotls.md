`vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-autotls`

Implement a process that automates the issuance of Letâ€™s Encrypt wilcard TLS certificates for nim-libp2p nodes. 
This would enable reliable browser-based clients to connect to libp2p nodes, regardless of the network topology which 
improves resilience and opens up a window to more capable browser clients. 
This task is limited to the client functionality; Server functionality could be implemented on a separate commitment.
