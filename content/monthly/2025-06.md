### P2P

#### highlights
- Implementation of GossipSub 1.4 is complete, and only final checks are pending
- Improved performance of Yamux by creating a zero allocation queue (this is to be used in other parts of nim-libp2p)
- Fixed yamux session close so streams are closed instead of reset
- Completed performance evaluations for GossipSub v1.4, v1.4+stagger, PPPt, 2.0
- Daily CI jobs are back online

- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-maintenance:maintenance`
  - Overview
    - debugging quic+gossipsub instability via DST lab; looks like multiple concurrent streams cause issues; ongoing code review/testing
    - benchmarking perf: lots of fixes, tweaks, and infra setup. nim-libp2p seems slower than other impls when running `perf` protocol; added quic tests, some metrics, and yamux optimizations
    - fixed half-open/half-closed stream handling in yamux and quic;
    - hole punching interop tests investigated, nim-libp2p is only impl with semi-working support; others either fail or lack tests entirely
