## Description

This commitment involves building prototypes using the Logos JS SDK framework, providing feedback on the framework's usability and capabilities, and contributing improvements back to the Logos tech stack. The work focuses on exploring the framework through practical prototyping, identifying areas for improvement, and actively contributing enhancements to benefit the broader Logos ecosystem.

The Logos Core prototyping will support Logos' strategic objectives by:
- **Framework Validation**: Testing the Logos JS SDK through real-world prototyping scenarios
- **Feedback Loop**: Providing actionable feedback on framework usability, API design, and developer experience
- **Tech Stack Contribution**: Contributing improvements, bug fixes, and enhancements back to the Logos tech stack
- **Iterative Improvement**: Using prototype development to identify and address framework limitations early

**Key Implementation Areas:**
- **Prototype Development**: Building working prototypes that exercise the Logos JS SDK framework
- **Framework Testing**: Testing framework capabilities, APIs, and developer experience through practical use
- **Feedback Documentation**: Documenting findings, pain points, and improvement opportunities
- **Contribution Back**: Submitting improvements, bug fixes, and enhancements to the Logos tech stack
- **Collaboration**: Working with framework maintainers to improve the SDK based on prototyping experience

**Alignment with IFT Narratives:**
- **Digital Liberties**: Prototyping applications that explore decentralized governance and user sovereignty concepts
- **Community Co-creation**: Contributing improvements back to the Logos tech stack for the benefit of all developers
- **Accessibility**: Identifying ways to make the Logos framework more accessible through prototyping and feedback
- **Brand Coherence**: Demonstrating commitment to improving Logos technologies through active contribution
