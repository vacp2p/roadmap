`ift:rfc:waku:updates-of-mature-waku-rfcs-2024q4`

Through discussion and curation, support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected Waku RFCs.

## Description

This commitment supports the audit of the following mature RFCs, which are 
either in draft or raw states:
- 10/WAKU2 
- 12/WAKU2-FILTER 
- 13/WAKU2-STORE 
- 14/WAKU2-MESSAGE 
- 19/WAKU2-LIGHTPUSH 
- 34/WAKU2-PEER-EXCHANGE
- 15/WAKU-BRIDGE


**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository for RFCs regarding all IFT 
  projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture, we hope to incentivize projects to submit their 
  RFCs to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs in their projects, 
  similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
