`vac:qa:vac:nim-libp2p-testing-2024q4`

## Description
Create test plans, implement tests, and increase coverage for all the [modules](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p?tab=readme-ov-file#modules) implemented in nim libp2p. Improve tooling around nim libp2p testing.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
- Nim-libp2p is a key component of the VAC ecosystem, and improving its testing coverage and tooling strengthens our internal expertise and the overall reliability of the network. 
- By enhancing these tests, and creating test plans, we support the RFC culture by providing feedback to the specifications, ensuring they align with real-world implementation.
- These efforts also contribute to scaling the project’s capacity, as better testing tools empower the open-source community to participate effectively.
