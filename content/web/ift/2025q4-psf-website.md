## Description

This commitment involves developing a comprehensive website for the Parallel Society Festival (PSF), a collectively organized gathering of forward-thinking network states, free cities, parallel societies, and intentional communities. The website will serve as the digital hub for this multi-day, co-organized event featuring talks, workshops, panels, debates, keynotes, showcases, performances, and art exhibits.

The PSF website will support Logos' strategic objectives by:
- **Community Mobilization**: Acting as a tool to attract volunteers, contributors, and future core developers aligned with Logos' ideals
- **IRL Engagement**: Showcasing the importance of local circles and real-world meetups as a blueprint for expanding Logos' community model
- **Cultural Identity**: Displaying Logos' shared culture, values, and movement-building initiatives
- **Developer Engagement**: Facilitating workshops, hackspaces, and developer meetups to source community feedback

**Alignment with IFT Narratives:**
- **Digital Liberties**: Showcasing technologies and communities that defend civil liberties in the digital age
- **Community Co-creation**: Enabling user-generated content and community participation through interactive features
- **Accessibility**: Making complex network state concepts approachable through intuitive web interfaces
- **Brand Coherence**: Maintaining consistent visual identity and messaging across the IFT ecosystem
