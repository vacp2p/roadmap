Porting RISC0 to ARM
## Description

This commitment comprises porting [RISC0](https://github.com/risc0/risc0) to ARM, 
as well as potential maintenance work by Roman from QA team.

### Narratives

With the Risc0 ARM Porting commitment, 

we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Providing the ARM-RISC0 codebase and expertise to the IFT teams, 
enabling them to successfully integrate it into their project.   
* Acquiring expertise in porting processes for future IFT projects.

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by: 
* Publishing the ARM-RISC0 codebase for the broader ecosystem.
