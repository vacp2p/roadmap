## Vac Monthly Report 2025/02

### P2P
#### highlights

### RFC
#### highlights
- In accordance with IFT and projects within IFT, wrote the first forum post as a way to inform/educate the internal and external community.
- Completed a huge fix for broken links on vac.dev - now it is up to the standards.

#### report
- `vac:rfc:ift:2025q1-culture-establishment-team-communication`
    - Overview
        - CODEX-MARKETPLACE forum post - as part of the process, once the team lead(s) complete the feedback loop, will be published on the forum.
        - As part of the conversation with Alvaro, got a definitive green light to start moving DA specifications into the rfc-index with the big piece of attention going to the fact that they will be changed for v2.
        - Received feedback from Hanno that the team can use more education on the writing specifications front. We discussed who would attend these workshops and are preparing to hold these on the company offsite.

- `vac:rfc:ift:2025q1-integration-with-qa:setup`
    - Overview
        - Brought back up to speed, establishing communications with QA and started populating the Notion table - https://www.notion.so/RFC-Implementation-and-test-coverage-1a18f96fb65c805c8bf3ca1fc04234b1 .


- `vac:rfc:nomos:2025q1-raw-rfcs-support-data-availability`
    - Overview
        - After several rounds of productive communication with several team members, got a green light that ALL specs that are in green can go into the rfc-index, starting with DA but with the note that there will be updates soon. 
        - Nomos team is in line with RFC team's values and this is a start of a fruitful collaboration, as our team members will be part of iteration planning sessions (the Nomos way of planning the upcoming work).

### Nim
#### highlights
- Multiple fixes and improvements for the langserver and the extension. Release is comming soon
- Initial work in the declarative parser for `nimble`. 
- `nimble` fixes

### Nescience  
#### Highlights  
- Analysed epoch restrictions and explored solutions to mitigate delays in SE and DE workflows by designing block-independent mechanisms for immediate finality.  
- Investigated multi-epoch constraints in SE & DE and evaluated different zk-rollup and zkVM-based approaches, including Miden’s impact on NSSA.  
- Conducted refactoring based on sandbox testnet feedback, implementing fixes for warning handling, error handling, and redundancy issues.  
- Worked on gas usage and opcode profiling for RISC0 zkVM, focusing on defining a gas model for smart contract execution.  
- Result-wise, we have a potential initial approach to go from multiple-epoch to single-epoch as well as a way to optimise SE and DE avoiding bottlenecks. This leads to an open question on how NSSA enables users to invoke public smart contracts with a private transaction.
- We also got some improvements regarding the gas model and limits on usage.

#### Report  
- `vac:nes:state-separation-architecture-poc`  
    - Overview:  
        - Analysed the impact of epoch-based execution on SE and DE workflows, identifying key bottlenecks and researching approaches to minimise delays.  
        - Investigated how zk-rollups and zkVMs are affected by epoch constraints and explored methods to submit ‘intermediate’ transactions alongside initial transactions to improve efficiency.  
        - Explored Miden’s approach to addressing NSSA execution constraints and considered circuit modifications for more efficient processing.  
        - Examined multi-epoch constraints in SE & DE to assess feasibility for single-epoch execution without compromising correctness or performance.  
        - Revisited time-release approaches and investigated using zkEVM instead of zkVM R0 for improved efficiency.  
        - Addressed sandbox testnet feedback by refactoring code to enhance maintainability, scalability, and performance. Fixes included improving warning handling, error handling, redundancy reduction, and updating JSON RPC documentation for node RPC.  
        - Developed a gas model for RISC0 zkVM by profiling opcode usage, memory costs, and computational overhead. This research will support a decentralised sequencer model with predictable and efficient gas consumption.
