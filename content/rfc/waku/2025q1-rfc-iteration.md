`vac:rfc:waku:2025q1-rfc-iteration`

Iteration commitments generally comprise:
through discussion and curation,
support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected Waku RFCs.

## Description

This commitment supports the audit of the following mature RFCs, which are 
either in draft or raw states:
- 10/WAKU2 
- 20/TOY-ETH-PM
- 21/WAKU2-FAULT-TOLERANT-STORE
- 26/WAKU2-PAYLOAD
- 33/WAKU2-DISCV5
- 36/WAKU2-BINDINGS-API

We will also include specification validation - 
editorial work through previous and future RFCs to improve them
(identify edge cases for example)

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository
for RFCs regarding all IFT 
  projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture,
we hope to incentivize projects to submit their RFCs
to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs
in their projects, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
