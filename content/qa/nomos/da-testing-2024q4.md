## Description
Implement data availability test plans for the Nomos project
and continuously update them due to evolving specs.

Since this feature is still in development,
tests will be conducted at multiple levels,
including unit and integration tests.
Given that the specifications for this feature are frequently changing,
the test cases will need to be regularly updated to reflect those changes.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
- By developing and constantly updating tests for data availability,
  VAC QA ensures that the feature's implementation aligns with high standards.
- This continuous testing helps identify any spec-related issues early,
  contributing to the RFC culture and improving spec quality.
- The effort also supports IFT's strategic objective of scaling the projectâ€™s capacity
  and ensuring a reliable system for future community involvement.
