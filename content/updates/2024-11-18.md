### vac:dst:

### vac:qa:
- `waku:status-go-functional-testing-2024q4:migrate-to-status-backend`
	- Created a [new PR](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/6063) and continued Sam's work on this by:
		- Removed duplicate and redundand code
		- Improved assertion
		- Adjusted PR to allign more with the existing status-go framework
		- Added linting and code format
		- Restructured existing framework to be more in lign with the best practices
		- Made new tests independent of docker-compose file
	- Talked with Anton, he reviewed the PR and next steps are:
		- We need to containarize everything so it can run in the status Jenkins CI. 
		  To do this, the existing framework needs to be changed to handle a dynamic number of nodes
		  And also allow node handling from the test container. Anton is currently working at this task
		- I need to adjust my PR to be in line with this approach
		- Anton and Igor asked to split the big PR into 2-3 smaller PRs
- `vac:qa:ift:projects-qa-strategy-2024q4:status`
	- Started investigation and wrote some notes
- `vac:qa:nomos:da-testing-2024q4:dispersal-storage-tests`

- `waku:interop-testing-2024q4:known-issues`
    - Adding  tests based on discussions with devs & opened bugs & [articles](https://blog.waku.org/explanation-series-light-protocols-and-edge-nodes/)
    - Create [PR 87](https://github.com/waku-org/waku-interop-tests/pull/87) & run tests on both nwaku&go-waku locally & adding variations to make go-waku works
