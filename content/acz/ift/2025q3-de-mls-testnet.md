## Description

This commitment involves integrating the multi-steward configurations 
to the codebase and refine its RFC with the latest findings. 
Finally, systematically prepare the architecture for testnet and load testing. 
The process includes presenting the findings, such as MLS over Waku and benchmarking, 
then, applying for the EF grant.

### Background

de-MLS is a decentralized, scalable, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) group messaging application 
with Ethereum-based authentication. 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive and mature RFC that outlines decentralized, 
secure, and scalable group key generation, designed to accommodate large numbers of users within a single group.

During 2025q2, we released the de-MLS RFC, including the seperate consensus RFC and 
consensus integrated base functionality poc implementation with the single steward. 

### Narratives

We will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:

- Develop the foundational framework for a decentralized, scalable messaging application
- Research and implement a scalable and decentralized consensus mechanism.

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:

- Develop a standardized decentralized messaging application over the Waku network, 
by providing a well-structured RFC and a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates 
its base functionality within the ecosystem. 
This will allow teams and organizations to build their own messaging applications 
while benefiting from these features.
- Create a proposal for the Ethereum Foundation (EF) to apply for EF grants 
to promote the project and gain support from the Ethereum ecosystem.
