### vac:dst:

- `vac:dst:status:2025q3-status-go-evaluation:*`
    - Keep summarizing all reports in a [Discord Document](https://www.notion.so/Status-backend-chat-protocol-benchmarks-WIP-22a8f96fb65c80b3b49ec05b87edee3c)
        - Repeat experiments 5 times to have better measurements
        - Repeated previous experiments due to [timestamp adittion in signal](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/6743#event-18606486245)
    - Fought with an issue when increasing nº of nodes, resulted in longer waiting times.
        - [Discord document](https://www.notion.so/Subscription-Performance-2348f96fb65c80c6b04dc2100f3e1fea?source=copy_link#2368f96fb65c805a9dafe10f4ebbb723)
- `vac:dst:waku:2025q3-waku-evaluation:store-dial-failure`
    - Found that even nodes peered with store node can have these failures
    - Making the same request multiple times to a node that fails the store/messages request can result in different results
    - Can consistently reproduce errors
    - Extended get_store_nodes.py to find which nodes fail, automatically retry and gather debug/peer data
    - Sometimes this results in 412 and sometimes this results in 200 with an error within the data.
    - [Further notes](https://www.notion.so/Experiments-for-nWaku-v36-0-21e8f96fb65c801e9ffcd25cf0d88370?source=copy_link#2328f96fb65c8008bb66cd46fb37662d)
