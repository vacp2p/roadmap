## Description

We will use realistic Waku node testing,
theoretical analysis, and simulations
to evaluate and improve Waku's scalability.
Performance measurements 
in waku components will be also done.
This includes identifying Wakuâ€™s limits
and measuring performance in various scenarios,
delivering concrete data and actionable insights
to validate or challenge our ideas.


### Background

### Narratives

These efforts will support the Conduit of Expertise narrative by
accelerating Waku Improvements,
providing measurable insights
to enhance developer experience
within and beyond the IFT ecosystem.
Enhancing RFC Development by enabling faster,
more informed RFC development
through performance insights during the drafting process.
