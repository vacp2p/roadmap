Finish up first version of the documentation for the staking protocol.

## Description

In the previous quarter we've committed to put out a first version of the staking protocol.
Part of that commitment was also to create a first version of the documentation that explains the system.
As we didn't  finish all the documentation in the previous quarter, we're committing to finishing this in Q1 2025.
