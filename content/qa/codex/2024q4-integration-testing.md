## Description
Extend existing integration tests for the Codex project
to ensure that all API endpoints are thoroughly tested,
as the current tests only scratch the surface.

Codex has a [rich API](https://api.codex.storage) that requires thorough testing
to ensure robustness across all endpoints and functionalities.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
By expanding the integration tests for Codex,
VAC QA contributes to maintaining high standards of API quality,
which directly supports the broader goal of ensuring spec adherence
and improving the project's reliability.
