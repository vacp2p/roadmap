Continue Waku Sync Integration testing in `nwaku`. 

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

* The VAC QA team contributes to the robustness of the Waku protocol suite
  by ensuring correctness and completeness of newer components such as Waku Sync.
* By exposing edge cases and ensuring spec alignment,
  these tests enhance the RFC lifecycle and provide confidence to teams building on top of `nwaku`.
