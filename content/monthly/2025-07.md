### Tokenomics (public version)
#### highlights

- Studied and implemented tier derivation logic using relational definitions and thresholds; demonstrated via a Streamlit dashboard.
- Reviewed and discussed block rewards, blockspace design, and NomosDA specs in collaboration with the Nomos team.
- Analyzed ecosystem design trade-offs between independent-token and unified-token models across growth, synergy, P–A alignment, and value capture.
- Proposed a hybrid ecosystem model to balance systemic risk and efficiency, bridging the autonomy-cohesion spectrum.
- Defined and modeled BU token backing strategies using pegging and emission rates linked to LOGOS token allocations.
- Designed flexible BU financial architectures supporting both independent token issuance and pure LOGOS-denominated models.
- Modeled LOGOS–BU arbitrage dynamics across multi-venue liquidity paths (LOGOS/ETH, BU/ETH, Treasury) under price shock conditions.
- Designed and evaluated a redemption throttling system using the Swing Adjustment Factor to mitigate fast value extraction during arbitrage windows.

#### report

- `vac:tke:status:karma-incentives`
  - Overview:
    - The work studies how tiers are defined, how they stand relatively and how we can algorithmically derive the tier threshold composition given these relations. This is practically demoed in the streamlit dashboard.
  - Completed tasks:
    - `vac:tke:status:karma-incentives:karma-tiers`

- `vac:tke:nomos:macroeconomy`
  - Overview:
    - Reviewed block rewards, blockspace, and NomosDA specifications after long discussions with Nomos team
  - Completed tasks:

    - `vac:tke:nomos:macroeconomy:review-blockspace`
    - `vac:tke:nomos:macroeconomy:review-nomos-da`

- `vac:tke:ift:logos-token`
  - Overview:
    - Comparison between two token ecosystem models: independent tokens vs unified token. The trade-off is autonomy vs. cohesion, with major implications for growth, synergies, principal-agent alignment, and value capture.
    - Conclusion favors a hybrid approach: while the unified model offers efficiency and synergy, it concentrates systemic risk. The independent model preserves flexibility and isolates failure, but suffers from fragmentation and inefficiencies.
    - Modeling how Business Units can back their tokens with LOGOS: pegging and emission rates to link BU and LOGOS token supply and control backing levels—ranging from full to partial backing or none.
    - Modeling flexible financial design: by allowing BUs to choose their own backing structures (e.g., fixed-rate fully backed or loosely backed models), the framework supports both independent token issuance and pure LOGOS utility token use.
    - Modeling arbitrage flow between LOGOS and BU tokens through a multi-pool setup (LOGOS/ETH, BU/ETH, Treasury) to show how fixed exchange rates can be exploited during price shocks — providing a path to enforce price alignment through arbitrage.
    - Introduction of redemption throttling via Swing Adjustment Factor: a dynamic mechanism that slows down redemptions as queue pressure builds, deterring rapid value leakage and controlling arbitrage intensity through progressively deferred token redemptions.
  - Completed tasks:
    - `vac:tke:ift:logos-token:formal-model`
    - `vac:tke:ift:logos-token:redemption-window`

### Nescience
#### highlights

- Investigated and chosen a zkVM that fits NSSA's needs.
- Investigated and settled on a model for public and private state.
- Implemented a complete version of sequencer.
- Implemented a PoC for selective privacy.
- Result-wise, we have settled on Risczero as the best fit for NSSA and also designed the public and private states and accounts that allows us to use selective privacy within the architecture. Our code was also improved by working on and advanced version of the sequencer as well as adding integration tests. 
#### report

- `vac:nes:state-separation-architecture-poc`  
    - Overview:  
        - Research-wise, we:
            - Investigated whether Risc0 / RV32IM has deterministic builds and deterministic sandboxed executions.
            - Investigated if Risc0 / RV32IM is friendly for gas metering and instruction counting.
            - Explored and analyzed the feasibility of selective privacy using a Risc0 based zkVM.
            - Investigated which VM+zkVMs (other than Risc0) are suitable for selective privacy.
            - Drafted Solana style adaptation: draw state-transition diagrams for private, shielded, and deshield flows.
            - Benchmarked qualitative trade-offs: validator hardware cost, parallelisability, sequencer-provability (impact on future L2 / Mina-style recursive proofs).
            - Analysed developer experience issues when privacy plumbing is removed from dApp code.
        - Engineering-wise, we implemented:
            - Sequencer internal checks modification: account store (addresses and balances), transactions with valid signatures, state transition for token transfer.
            - Sequencer RPC improvements: return of balance, transaction details.
            - Sequencer stability improvements: mechanisms against replay attacks, integration tests.
