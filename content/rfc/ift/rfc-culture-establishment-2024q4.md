`ift:rfc:vac:rfc-culture-establishment-2024q4`

Creating a plan in Notion, compiling information about the RFC process,
publishing a forum post, initially informing and discussing with teams
within the IFT ecosystem.

## Description

This commitment involves creating a plan using Notion documentation 
and the initiation of implementing RFC culture 
through communication with teams in the IFT ecosystem. 
The effort will align with critical project milestones, ensuring that no 
information is published prematurely. The focus will be on creating a task list 
for communication and a go-to resource (in Notion) for information about RFC 
culture.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team aims to become a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By demonstrating the value of the RFC process, we want future projects
- to submit their RFCs to our team of rfc-editors.
- One of our goals is for the broader web3 community to use our RFCs in their 
  projects and ecosystems, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
