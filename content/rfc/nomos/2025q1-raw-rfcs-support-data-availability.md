`vac:rfc:nomos:2025q1-raw-rfcs-support-data-availability`

Supporting the process of creating new RFCs based on DA subprotocols.

## Description

This commitment supports delivering raw RFCs for Nomos Data Availability (DA) 
through discussions, support, and inquiries. 

The RFCs will focus on DA in Nomos as its initial implementation is ongoing. 
This RFC will be split into different sub-protocols/different RFCs:

- Dispersal 
- Replication
- Samping

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to be a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture, we aim to incentivize projects to apply their 
  RFCs to the team of rfc-editors.
- We aim for the broader web3 community to use our RFCs within their projects 
  and ecosystems, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
