Provide code reviews and feedback to the MLS team on their smart contracts.

## Description

The ACZ team is working on a protocol that users smart contracts for access control lists. 
We agreed to offer them review sessions and consulting on the changes they are planning to do.

In practice, 
that means ACZ will add our team members as reviewers to their pull requests as they see need. 
In addition, 
they can schedule sessions with us to discuss specific things about smart contract usage in their protocol.

## Task List

There are no concrete tasks associated to this commitment.
