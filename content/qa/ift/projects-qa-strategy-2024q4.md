## Description
Document existing QA strategy for IFT projects.

Create a knowledge base containing the QA strategy for all projects under the IFT umbrella.<br/>
For each project, we will document the existing tests, coverage, how and when they are run, any identified gaps, and recommendations for improvement.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**  
- By documenting and evaluating the QA strategy of each IFT project, VAC QA strengthens the overall efficiency and collaboration within the IFT ecosystem. 
- This initiative will ensure that projects are aligned with the best practices, identify areas for improvement, and foster knowledge sharing across teams. 
- It contributes to maintaining a high standard for both internal and external contributions by helping keep projects well-tested and reliable.
