## Description
Implement data availability test plans for the Nomos project at the cluster level, 
focusing on protocol compatibility, internal interactions, data confidentiality, and resilience against failures.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
- By developing and constantly updating tests for data availability,
  VAC QA ensures that the feature's implementation aligns with high standards.
- This continuous testing helps identify any spec-related issues early,
  contributing to the RFC culture and improving spec quality.
- The effort also supports IFT's strategic objective of scaling the projectâ€™s capacity
  and ensuring a reliable system for future community involvement.
