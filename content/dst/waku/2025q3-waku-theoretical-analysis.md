## Description
Conduct theoretical analysis Waku project
to explore their feasibility, limitations, and potential outcomes.
By modeling different scenarios and comparing theoretical expectations
with real-world experiments, we can refine our understanding
and guide future research directions.
We will perform analysis of parameters that are
interesting for Waku (bandwidth, message latency, ...) and how
parameters (number of nodes, payload, protocols) affects them.
This work ensures that projects are grounded in solid theoretical foundations
before moving to practical implementation.

### Background
Theoretical analysis plays a critical role in scientific research,
providing a structured approach to evaluating ideas before they are tested experimentally. 
By analyzing different models, assumptions, and constraints, 
we can identify key challenges early on and optimize experimental designs.
This process helps save resources, minimize risks, 
and increase the likelihood of meaningful discoveries. 
Furthermore, comparing theoretical results with experimental data
allows for continuous refinement, leading to more accurate predictions and insights.

### Narratives
Conduit of Expertise: Sharing theoretical insights with the community 
fosters a culture of rigorous scientific discussion, 
allowing researchers to challenge and improve upon each otherâ€™s work.
Open dialogue and peer review strengthen the foundation of our research efforts.
Premier Research of Destination: A strong theoretical framework
enhances the credibility and depth of our research, 
ensuring that projects are built on well-reasoned analysis.


## Task list

> *Note*: Tasks need to be coordinated with other projects

### Waku bandwidth

* fully qualified name: `vac:dst:waku:2025q3-waku-theoretical-analysis:bandwidth`
* owner: Farooq
* status: 0%
* start-date: 2025-09-17
* end-date: 2025-09-30

#### Description
Calculate the theoretical expected value for Waku bandwidth usage. 
The calculation should be similar for nim-libp2p as well.
Derive a formula that can depend on the number of nodes, 
payload size, and message rate. This result will be used to compare the bandwidth usage
in Kubernetes with the theoretical values.

### Waku message dissemination

* fully qualified name: `vac:dst:waku:2025q3-waku-theoretical-analysis:message-dissemination`
* owner: Farooq
* status: 0%
* start-date: 2025-09-17
* end-date: 2025-09-30

#### Description
Calculate the theoretical expected value for Waku latency. 
The calculation should be similar for nim-libp2p as well.
Derive a formula that can depend on the number of nodes, 
payload size, and message rate, if they apply. This result 
will be used to compare the latencies measured
in Kubernetes with the theoretical values.
