- `ift:2025q1-libp2p-mix-poc:simple-gossipsub-poc`
    - Based on the discussions:
        - The exit must support GossipSub when part of the pub-sub topic, requiring its Mix instance to invoke the local GossipSub handler via the exit abstraction (already implemented).
        - If the exit is not part of the pub-sub topic, it establishes a client-only connection to the destination.
    - Instead, implemented a version where the *destination MUST support Mix*, allowing the destination’s Mix instance to invoke its local GossipSub instance, sending the message as if it originated there (branch link will be updated).
        - Still need to fix callback integration with GossipSub.
        - Next: Update PoC to reflect these changes.
- `ift:2025q1-libp2p-mix-poc:blogposts`
