`ift:rfc:nomos:data-availability-raw-rfc-2024q4`

Initiating the process of documentation to raw RFC process for Nomos Data Availability (DA).
## Description

This commitment revolves around supporting the delivery of a raw RFC for Nomos Data Availability through discussion, support and inquiring about the updates. The team plans to start establishing the RFC culture within the Nomos  ecosystem, in order to have standardized specifications within all IFT ecosystems.

This RFC will be focusing on Data Availability within Nomos, as it is currently undergoing initial implementation. During the commitment, depending on how the implementation and ongoing communication goes, it might be decided to split this RFC into several new ones or open different ones. 

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

* The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository for RFCs regarding all the IFT projects.
* By providing information and benefits of the RFC Culture, our goal is projects being incentivized to apply their RFCs to the team of rfc-editors, in the future.
* One of our ideals is to have the broader web3 community utilize our RFCs to potentially implement within their projects and ecosystems (similar to how [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) works).
