Iteration commitments generally comprise:
through discussion and curation,
support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected RFCs.

## Description

This commitment covers the writing of the following mature RFCs
according to COSS, based on the Notion documentation:
- [Key Protocol Specification](https://file.notion.so/f/f/1518abd9-c08f-4989-93c1-96525e62bce5/c8d74616-c4ff-4d71-a1fa-4031a8fc2f47/NSSA_Key_Protocol.pdf?table=block&id=1278f96f-b65c-8029-ada6-e68bd863432a&spaceId=1518abd9-c08f-4989-93c1-96525e62bce5&expirationTimestamp=1747180800000&signature=kr6-7kTbmY_yCFyU6Iltn0ZFhbIq5YBckp_YvWDXNiU&downloadName=1.+NSSA+Key+Protocol.pdf)
- [UTXO Specifications](https://www.notion.so/3-UTXO-Specifications-1498f96fb65c8013a6add7c18496c02c)

We will also include specification validation - 
to make sure there are no errors, missing information, inconsistencies
and that the specification is up to standards.



**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository
for RFCs regarding all IFT 
  projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture,
we hope to incentivize projects to submit their RFCs
to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs
in their projects, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
