## Description

It is a continuous task to improve GossipSub performance by lowering bandwidth consumption and network-wide message dissemination time. 
These improvements also indirectly support scalability by allowing for a larger supported network size, higher message counts, and increased message volumes. 
This work contributes to the development of GossipSub specification proposal(s) and publishing findings in articles and blog posts.
