`vac:rfc:nomos:2025q4-rfc-iteration`

Iteration commitments generally comprise:
through discussion and curation,
support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected Nomos RFCs.

## Description

This commitment supports the process of the writing raw RFCs,
from the existing documentation and specifications in Nomos team Notion.
We will also include specification validation - 
editorial work through previous and future RFCs to improve them
(identify edge cases for example)
as well as making sure that the relevant document has enough information
in order to ease the developer experience for coming developers.

The specifications in pipeline:
- Cryptarchia v1 Protocol Specification
- Cryptarchia v1 Bootstrapping & Synchronization
- Cryptarchia Fork Choice Rule
- Total Stake Inference
- Proof of Leadership Specification


**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository
for RFCs regarding all IFT 
  projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture,
we hope to incentivize projects to submit their RFCs
to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs
in their projects, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
