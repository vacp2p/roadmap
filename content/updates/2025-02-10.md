## Vac 2025/02/10

### vac:p2p:
- `ift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements`
  - Finalized staggered message sending article (Only tagguy's feedback part is left).
  - Created rust-libp2p gossipsub simulation for shadow. Latency, bandwidth computations are working fine
	- Still need to add hooks for additional stats
	- Still need to control inter-message delays between publishers (need to look timeouts/tokio::sleep)	
- `ift:2025q1-nimlibp2p-wrapping-ngtcp2:tls_handshake`
    - Wrapped some additional functions in [nim-ngtcp2#10](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-ngtcp2/pull/10)
        - Had to do this manually, since nimterop had trouble generating the functions
        - Tried using [futhark](https://github.com/PMunch/futhark) instead, because nimterop repository seems abandoned (and c2nim too). Ended up opening this [issue](https://github.com/PMunch/futhark/issues/138) since `futhark` does not work too well either (requires some manual work afterwards) 
    - [PR](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-quic/pull/55) in progress in nim-quic
        - Uses crypto functions from picotls. 
        - I'm currently working on creating the PicoTLS context ([This](https://gist.github.com/richard-ramos/e01c9ec091a67e2e6042a86bf7359c26#file-server-c-L30-L59) but in nim)
- `ift:2025q1-nimlibp2p-wrapping-ngtcp2:certificate_validation`
    - Fix invalid certificate generation in [nim-libp2p#1209](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1209)
    - Looking into CI issues on macos-arm64 and windows
- `ift:2025q1-nimlibp2p-maintenance`
    - [PR](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1244) refactor(pubsub): do not raise exceptions on publish
- `misc/admin`
    - Interviewed 1 candidate for P2P engineer position
    - 2 CC 1 day off
