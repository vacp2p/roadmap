`vac:rfc:nescience:2025q2-rfc-iteration`

Iteration commitments generally comprise:
through discussion and curation,
support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected RFCs.

## Description

This commitment supports the process of the choosing which raw RFCs,
from the existing documentation to be put in pipeline to be written or updated. 

This commitment supports the audit of the following mature RFCs, which are 
either in draft or raw states:
- Key Protocol Specification
- UTXO Specification

We will also include specification validation - 
editorial work through previous and future RFCs to improve them
(identify edge cases for example)



**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository
for RFCs regarding all IFT 
  projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture,
we hope to incentivize projects to submit their RFCs
to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs
in their projects, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
