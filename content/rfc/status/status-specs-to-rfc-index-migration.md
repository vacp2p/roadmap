`ift:rfc:status:status-specs-to-rfc-index-migration`

Migrating the status specs from specs.status.im to the rfc-index.
## Description

This commitment revolves around migrating [status specs](https://specs.status.im/)
to rfc-index as part of the effort to have rfc-index
as a main repository for specification.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to be a repository for RFCs across all IFT projects.
- We aim for the broader web3 community to use our RFCs within their projects 
  and ecosystems, similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).

## Task List
