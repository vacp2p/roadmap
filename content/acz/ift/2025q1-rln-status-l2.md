Exploring Status L2 architecture for RLN integration
## Description
This commitment involves investigating the Status L2 architecture to 
integrate RLN for enabling a gasless layer 2 solution.

### Background
Status L2 is a rollup with Linea and builds a platform with the capacity 
to support SocialFi and GameFi apps, governance experiments, the Status voting system, and more
 â€“ all while aiming to keep transaction costs low and throughput high. 
Status L2 will incorporate a gasless feature, necessitating an effective anti-spam mechanism. 
Rate-Limiting Nullifier (RLN) is a potential solution that could be deployed on Status L2 
to prevent spam and support the gasless functionality. 

### Narratives
 By utilizing this commitment, we will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Sharing the RLN knowledge with the Status L2 team.
* Delivering the modified RLN design to make Status L2 gasless. 

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:
* Offering a use-case to the ecosystem that can be used for other gasless roll-up projects.
