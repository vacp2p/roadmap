`ift:rfc:waku:2025q1-rfc-iteration`

Through discussion and curation, support the process of auditing raw, draft, mature selected Waku RFCs.

## Description

This commitment supports the process of the choosing RFCs,
from the existing documentation. 
It includes:
- Cryptarchia
- Data Availability



**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**

- The VAC RFC team plans to become a repository for RFCs regarding all IFT 
  projects.
- By promoting the RFC culture, we hope to incentivize projects to submit their 
  RFCs to the rfc-editors team.
- We aim to have the broader web3 community use our RFCs in their projects, 
  similar to [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).
