Specifying disc-NG and releasing a document that collects the requirements of discovery
## Description
This commitment entails specifying disc-NG, as proposed in  
[the paper](https://sonnino.com/papers/disc-ng.pdf), with a focus on implementability.  
We also aim to collect requirements, and the exploration includes assessing their suitability for IFT projects.

### Narratives

By utilizing discovery exploration commitment, 
We will reinforce the Conduit of Expertise narrative by:
* Providing the disc-NG RFC that will be tailored for many IFT teams, such as Waku, Nomos, and Codex. 

We will also strengthen the Premier Research Destination narrative by:
* Provides open-source disc-NG RFC information to the community.
