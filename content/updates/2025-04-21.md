## Vac 2025/04/21

### vac:p2p:
- `ift:2025q1-gossipsub-perf-improvements`
    - Submitted stagger send article on arxiv. The article is available [online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10365)
    - Worked on large message handling (GossipSub v1.4) revision. Need 2 days to finalize.
    - Worked on GossipSub v1.4 specs feedback. Working on revised draft based on feedback
    - Spent some time on Nimbus integeration in Ethshadow. Now its terminating on unsupported system call signalfd4 (working on adding support for it)
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-kad-dht:routing-and-rpc`
    - [vacp2p/nim-libp2p#1324](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1324) feat(kad-dht): find nodes (WIP) 
- `vac:p2p:acz:2025q2-acz-consulting:libp2p-mix-consulting`
    - Assist in the modification of DST Gossipsub Test Node to run mix
        - [vacp2p/mix#18](https://github.com/vacp2p/mix/pull/18) chore: allow overriding paths
        - [vacp2p/dst-gossipsub-test-node#7](https://github.com/vacp2p/dst-gossipsub-test-node/pull/7) chore: write mix files to path, and remove peercount
        - [vacp2p/dst-gossipsub-test-node#8](https://github.com/vacp2p/dst-gossipsub-test-node/pull/8) chore: update dockerfile
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-autotls:certificate-request-auth`
    - Working on a [standalone autoTLS script](https://github.com/gmelodie/nim-autotls) which contains:
        - Partial ACME client to request a challenge from Let's Encrypt
        - [PeerID auth](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/http/peer-id-auth.md)
    - Opened a [PR on `nim-jwt`](https://github.com/yglukhov/nim-jwt/pull/22) to allow for flattened JSON JWT conversion, which we need for communicating with the ACME server
    - Some observations:
        - There are no nim ACME clients (had to build half of one), we could write one, but we'd have to maintain it too
        - Nim RSA key handling support is lacking a bit
        - We had to implement peerID auth
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-webtransport:http3`
    - finished wrapping nghttp3 lib -> [nim-nghttp3](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-nghttp3) repo
    - ci, more precisly setting up nghttp3 source, is not working for windows. i'll come back to this at later stages after webtransport is implemented.  since debugging this took much time and is not really required to make progress on webtransport front (as unix based ci is working).
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-test-coverage:qa-consulting`
    - assisting radek in navigating improvments in nim-libp2p tests.
        - proposed improvments that are likly to half total test execution time.
            - ci completing in 15-20min and windows platfrom 23-25min, previusly >30min and >50min respectivly
        - most proposed improvements are still not even tested -> there is still a lot of room to improve total tests execution time (in local and ci)
- `vac:p2p:ift:2025q2-nimlibp2p-maintenance:maintenance`
    - [libp2p/website#1](https://github.com/vacp2p/libp2p-website/pull/1) chore: update implementation status for nim-libp2p
    - Small fix: broken links in `nim-libp2p`'s docs [#1332](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/pull/1332)
    - Might have found a [bug in one of `nim-libp2p`'s dependencies](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/issues/1333) (namely: `nim-quic` v0.1.0)
