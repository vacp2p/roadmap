`vac:qa:waku:2025q2-status-go-functional-testing`

## Description
Collaborate with the Status QA team to improve functional testing coverage 
by adding new tests outlined in this [epic](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/issues/6064). 
Additionally, work on enhancing the framework to support more advanced functional testing scenarios.
Note: This commitment is being deferred to Q2 to avoid overcommitting, but tasks may be taken on in Q1 if time permits.

**Alignment with VAC Narratives:**
* By helping create a robust functional testing framework for Status Go,
  VAC QA contributes directly to the narrative of internal collaboration and efficiency.
* By finding issues in the project code and specs during testing,
  VAC QA strengthens the RFC culture, contributing to continuous improvement and community engagement.
