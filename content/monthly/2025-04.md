    - Overview:
        - After discussion with the team, decided to include 2 new RFCs: Key Protocol and UTXO specifications.
- `admin/misc`
    - Overview:
        - On the offsite, we held an RFC workshop, it was successful so we can try to make it a series (through town hall or a standalone medium, like an "RFC Call"). 
        - Improvements to COSS based on status, we made the process clearer now and it went through several rounds of review.
        - Working on collaboration with QA.
        - Potential commitment: start writing up RFCs from Web3, not just within the IFT projects.
    - Report:
        - Specification writing workshop, guideline (can maybe become an RFC at some point): https://www.notion.so/Specification-Writing-Workshop-1c48f96fb65c80adb159e74170e245cc

### Nescience
#### Highlights
- Designated scope and responsibilities for NSSA components (wallet, SDK and zkVM) for end-to-end programmability.
- Investigated and designed two execution consistency mechanisms (RBC and VBC) for private invocations that update the public state.
- Investigated selective privacy wrappers for public functions, and the consistency between selective privacy and consistency mechanisms.
- Started defining the formal execution model for shielded and deshielded transactions. 
- Engineering wise, implemented smart contract interactions with public state and extracted smart contract primitives.
- Result-wise, we have clear improvements in end to end programmability enhancements and SE/DE execution models. Also, our code has improved and additional features has been added and redundancies removed.


#### Report
- `vac:nes:state-separation-architecture-poc`  
    - Overview:  
        - Fully described transaction lifecycle from wallet to SDK to zkVM to sequencer.
        - Described SDK access and calls to Risc0.
        - Designed execution consistency mechanisms (RBC and VBC) for private invocations that update the public state and determined use-cases for each.
        - Investigated how smart contracts can be written or compiled to support hybrid execution (both public and private calls). 
        - Explored contract-based and function-based privacy within NSSA.
        - Explored selective privacy wrappers for public functions (circuit designs for these wrappers were outlined).
        - Examined re-run approach and verified approach for execution consistency mechanism.
        - Implementated storing smart contract data in DB.
        - Implemented smart contract context generation.
        - Implemented of public state provability.
